This archive contains the UPV-Curry system,
a novel Curry implementation developed at the 
Technical University of Valencia (UPV).

It may (at least on 7/14/2015) be found at http://users.dsic.upv.es/grupos/elp/upv-curry/upv-curry.html)

Here you can find the following files:

*.pl:                 The source code of the UPV-Curry interpreter.
            
prelude.curry         The UPV-Curry prelude file, which contains
                      the main data types and function declarations.

upv-curry_manual.tex: The LaTeX source for the UPV-Curry User's Manual.
            
README:               This help file.

examples:             A subdirectory containing several Curry programs
                      which show the syntax and main features of the 
                      language Curry.

This interpreter requires SICStus Prolog v3.x and it needs no
previous installation. You must load the "main.pl" source file to 
start the interpreter.

You can use the system as described in the "UPV-Curry User's Manual".
