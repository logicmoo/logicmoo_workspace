This directory contains an implementation of Probabilistic Horn abduction.

The implementation is written in Prolog. It has been tested with both Sicstus
Prolog and Quintus Prolog. It should be very portable.

To run the program, in Prolog, do
| ?- compile('pha-int.tex').

To load a rulebase "adderinf" do
| ?- thconsult(adderinf).


The code is in the file 'pha-int.tex'. This can be formatted using Latex
by changing one character at the beginning of the file.

The file 'pha-bn.ps' (in ftp/local/poole/papers) is a paper that
describes the theory behind probabilistic Horn abduction. It is to
appear in Artificial Intelligence.

The following are rule bases:
'adderinf' is a cascaded adder (as described in 'pha-bn.ps').
'bnet' is the Bayesian network described in 'pha-bn.ps'.
'depiction' is a depiction example (as in 'pha-bn.ps').
'inv3' is three cascaded inverters.
  


The following is a trace of a program (with my comments in upper case):
