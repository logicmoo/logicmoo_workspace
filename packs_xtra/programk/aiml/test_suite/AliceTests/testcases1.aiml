<!-- 
This file contains test cases to verify the correct operations of the  <bot name="~genotype"/>.
It should be placed in the directory where all the standard bot <bot name="~genotype"/> files are
located.  It expects to find and use some of the standard predicates, and CATEGORIES
found in the core <bot name="~genotype"/> set.
Each test case is documented with what is expected to be the correct response.  They
should be written to be as self contained as possible.
 -->

<!-- Test case #1.

This testcase tests the bot's ability to immediatly set the value of "name"
using the <think> tag, and then use <get_name/> within the same category to
display the entered name.  It is complicated by using the <random> tag
to generate varied responses.

TESTER: testcase call me james.
(BOT replies with one of the following:)
BOT: OK. I'll call you james.
BOT: Hello james.
BOT: How are you james.

TESTER: testcase call me wally.
(BOT replies with one of the following:)
BOT: OK. I'll call you wally.
BOT: Hello wally.
BOT: How are you wally.

<!-- Test case #2.

This testcase tests the bot's ability to properly set the bot's last response
into the various THAT value holders.  It issues a multi sentence response, which
should result in the bot's last response being set to only the value of the
last sentence issues.

<!-- Test case #3.

This testcase tests the bot's ability to properly set a predicate within a
<condition> tag using the <li> format for only the TRUE <li> element, using the
<think> tag and also not set other predicates which also have <think> tags
within the condition that are FALSE.

<!-- Test case #4.

This testcase tests the bot's ability to properly set the TOPIC in a CATEGORY
and then use that setting in a <condition> tag to craft a response within
the same CATEGORY that TOPIC was set in.
