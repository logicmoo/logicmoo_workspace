# SWI-Prolog's features

## Overview

SWI-Prolog is a versatile implementation of the
[Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) language. Although
SWI-Prolog gained its popularity primarily in education, its development
is mostly driven by the needs for __application development__. This is
facilitated by a rich interface to other IT components by supporting
many document types and (network) protocols as well as a comprehensive
low-level interface to C that is the basis for high-level interfaces to
C++, Java (bundled), C#, Python, etc (externally available). Data type
extensions such as [dicts](</pldoc/man?section=bidicts>) and
[strings](</pldoc/man?section=strings>) as well as full support for
Unicode and unbounded integers simplify smooth exchange of data with
other components.

SWI-Prolog aims at __scalability__. Its robust support for
multi-threading exploits multi-core hardware efficiently and simplifies
embedding in concurrent applications. Its _Just In Time Indexing_ (JITI)
provides transparent and efficient support for predicates with millions
of clauses.

SWI-Prolog __unifies many extensions__ of the core language that have
been developed in the Prolog community such as _tabling_, _constraints_,
_global variables_, _destructive assignment_, _delimited continuations_
and _interactors_.

SWI-Prolog offers a variety of __development tools__, most of which may
be combined at will. The native system provides an editor written in
Prolog that is a close clone of Emacs. It provides _semantic_
highlighting based on real time analysis of the code by the Prolog
system itself. Complementary tools include a graphical debugger,
profiler and cross-referencer. Alternatively, there is a mode for
GNU-Emacs and, Eclipse plugin called
[PDT](https://sewiki.iai.uni-bonn.de/research/pdt/docs/start) and a VSC
[plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arthurwang.vsc-prolog),
each of which may be combined with the native graphical tools. Finally,
a _computational notebook_ and web based IDE is provided by
[SWISH](https://swish.swi-prolog.org).  SWISH is a versatile tool that
can be configured and extended to suit many different scenarios.

SWI-Prolog provides an add-on distribution and installation mechanism
called __packs__. A _pack_ is a directory with minimal organizational
conventions and a _control_ file that describes the origin, version,
dependencies and automatic upgrade support. Packs can be installed from
an archive, GIT repository or URL using pack_install/1. Packs are used
to share code in the community. The pack system has grown a couple of
eco systems for dealing with types, coroutining, etc.


## Server applications

SWI-Prolog is equipped with an extensive __web server__ (HTTP) framework
that can be used both for providing (REST) services and end-user
applications based on HTML5+CSS+JavaScript. Pengines (Prolog engines)
allow clients to run queries against a client-provided program on a
remote server using a generic API. Such programs can be executed in a
_sandbox_.

For (web) server support SWI-Prolog provides __scalable multi
threading__. We measured an 80 times speedup running on a 128 core power
pc system. This feature makes SWI-Prolog attractive for CPU intensive
server tasks where multiple clients require access to a large shared and
possibly dynamic dataset. Note that many other high-level languages such
as Python and Node.js only use a single core and switch between tasks
based on blocking I/O. This approach generally provides good resource
usage for I/O intensive services with a high number of connections but a
task blocking on a computation delays all other clients. As SWI-Prolog's
__global garbage collectors__ for atoms and removed dynamic clauses run
__fully asynchronous__ in a dedicated thread, its (soft) _real time_
behaviour is excellent.

SWI-Prolog has several unique features that reduce the need to restart
servers for fixing bugs or injecting diagnostic code. Its __incremental
compilation__ combined with generally local and backtrackable data
structures (undo) allows for __patching the program without
restarting__. SWI-Prolog allows for reloading running code from another
thread safely, provided the signature of the running predicates is not
changed. This implies it is allowed to add, remove and modify clauses
but it is _not_ allowed to add, remove or reorder arguments. Still, this
feature is valuable for __hot-fixing servers__ or __inject diagnostic
code__ to a server without restarting.


## Prolog as unifying language

Although Prolog is widely recognised as a _special purpose language_ for
tasks such as rule evaluation we consider it primarily a platform that
is suitable to be used as _glue_ between various components. The main
reason for this is that __data is at the core of many modern
applications__ while there is a large variety in which data is
structured and stored. Classical query languages such as SQL, SPARQL,
XPATH, etc. can each deal with one such format only, while Prolog can
provide a concise and natural query language for each of these formats
that can either be executed directly or be compiled into dedicated query
language expressions. Prolog's __relational paradigm__ fits well with
tabular data (RDBMS), while __optimized support for recursive code__
fits well with tree and graph shaped data (RDF).

Prolog is a suitable language for _Domain Specific Languages_ (DSL).
SWI-Prolog has improved this support by syntactical extensions to the
Prolog language. Examples of valid syntax that can be processed
unambiguously are ``a[1][2]``, `point{x:1, y:1}` and `function()`. In
addition, __quasi quotations__ allow for safe and clean integration
with the syntax of arbitrary languages. For example, the following
statement specifies a fragment of JavaScript with a _safe_ interpolation
of the Prolog value `X`.

    {|javascript(X)||var x = X;|}


## Feature list

Below is a list of what we consider key features of SWI-Prolog with
links to the relevant documentation.

### Engine

    * *fast* compilation. E.g., loads [WordNet
    3.0](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/download/current-version)
    in 14 seconds from the Prolog source or 0.4 seconds from _quick load
    file_ format (see qcompile/1).  The WordNet source counts 821,515
    lines.  System: Ubuntu 16.04 on Intel i7-3770, 32Gb memory.

    * *Robust* and *|free of memory leaks|*.  In use for several
    servers that run 24x7 (including this web service).

    * *Small*. The full development environment, including graphics,
    libraries and many interface packages, requires approximately 100MB
    hard disk. The kernel is about 1.4MB (Ubuntu 16.04 .so file)

    * *Scales* well for large applications. *No limits* on program size,
    atom length, term arity or integer values. No performance
    degradation on predicates with many (indexed) facts.

    * *|Just-In-Time|* indexing of both static and dynamic code on any
    argument greatly simplifies handling multi-moded relations with
    many clauses. As of version 7.5, __multi-argument JITI__ is
    supported. This creates an index for the combined value of two
    arguments if there is no selective single-argument index.  As of
    version 7.7 we also support indexing on the arguments of compound
    terms.  This feature notably improves the performance for handling
    _terminals_ in grammar rules (DCGs).

    * *|Unbounded integer|* and *rational* number arithmetic
    based on [[GMP library][<gmp:>]].

    * The goodies: *modules* (upward compatible to Quintus and SICStus),
    *|garbage-collection|* (transparent to C/C++-code, including *atom*
    and *clause* garbage collection), *|last-call|* optimisation,
    dynamic expansion of the runtime stacks, *|exception-handling|*
    (including C/C++ interface for both catching and throwing
    exceptions).

    * *|attributed variables|*, coroutining (freeze/2, when/2, dif/2),
    global variables, cyclic terms.

    * Flag-controlled handling of *|occurs-check|* (false/true/error)
    see current_prolog_flag/2. Efficient implementation of occurs
    checking that only verifies that _new bindings_ do not introduce
    cycles.

    * *UNICODE* character set handling internal. Ideal for web and
    international applications.

    * *|[[Multi-threading][</pldoc/man?section=threads>]]|* support: run multiple
    pre-emptively scheduled prolog engines on the same database.

    * [*Engines*](</pldoc/man?section=engines>), also known as
    *interactors* provide _coroutines_ that can be used for state
    accumulation and massive concurrency for e.g., _swarm intelligence_
    and simulations.

    * [*Delimited continuations*](</pldoc/man?section=delcont>) is a
    powerful building block for new control structures and realise
    __aspect programming__.

    * [Tabling (SLG resolution)](<pldoc/man?section=tabling>) provides
    a more robust resolution technique for solving queries over complex
    interrelated rules with guaranteed termination.

    * Following XSB, the 8.1.x development series provide _well founded
    semantics_ for negation as well as incremental tabling to
    automatically update affected tabling with a changing knowledge
    base. This provides _Datalog_ style _deductive database_ features.

### Constraint handling

    * Libraries for
    *|[[CHR][</pldoc/man?section=chr>]]|* (Constraint Handling
    Rules), *|[[clp(FD)][</pldoc/man?section=clpfd>]]|*,
    *|[[clp(R,Q)][</pldoc/man?section=clpqr>]]|* and various others.

### Connectivity

    * SWI-Prolog provides extensive client and *server* libraries
    for *HTTP*.  The HTTP server framework deals with generating
    HTML, exchange of JSON or XML, authentication, sessions, and
    much more.  Both client and server supports HTTPS.

    * Flexible and fast interface to the *|C-|* and *|C++-language|*.
    The interface allows for calling both ways, handling of
    non-determinism both ways and *embedding* of the SWI-Prolog kernel
    in C/C++ projects.

    * Interfaces to high level languages such as
    Java using [JPL](</packages/jpl/>), Python and C# are available.

    * Database connectivity is provided by the
    *|[[ODBC][</pldoc/package/odbc.html>]]|* interface.

    * Low level network support includes _sockets_ (both TCP
    and UDP), *|[[SSL][</pldoc/package/ssl.html>]]|* and
    [TIPC](</pldoc/package/tipc.html>).

    * Libraries for parsing and generating
    [__SGML/XML/HTML__](</pldoc/package/sgml.html>),
    [__JSON__](</pldoc/man?section=jsonsupport>) and
    [__YAML__](<pldoc/man?section=yaml>)

    * Linked Data (RDF) support includes reading and writing many
    RDF formats (RDF/XML, Turtle, Ntriples, NQuads) and an efficient
    triple store.  See the [semweb](</pldoc/package/semweb.html>)
    package.


### Development tools

    * [[Source-level debugger][<gtrace.html>]] on all platforms that
    supports graphics through XPCE (Windows, Unix/Linux, MacOSX).

    * Execution *|profiler.txt|* (time and call statistics) for all
    major platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOSX).

    * *|[[Cross-Referencer][gxref.txt]]|*. gxref/0 provides a graphical
    front-end for the extensible Prolog cross-referencer (xref).

    * *|Literate programming|* support through
    *|[[PlDoc][</pldoc/package/pldoc.html>]]|*. Provides integrated view
    on manual and application documentation and producing LaTeX
    documentation for your application.

    * *|Unit testing|* support through
    *|[[PlUnit][</pldoc/package/plunit.html>]]|*.

    * [*SWISH*](https://swish.swi-prolog.org) provides a web-based
    platform for developing and running Prolog code in a collaborative
    environment.

### Compatibility

    * Comprehensive set of built-in predicates, covering *|Part 1 of the
    ISO standard|*, the de-facto *Edinburgh* Prolog standard and
    important parts of Quintus and SICStus Prolog. Fair
    compatibility to Ciao, YAP and GNU-Prolog.  Although the aim is to
    maintain compatibility wherever possible, SWI-Prolog deliberately
    deviates from the ISO standard to accommodate additional
    functionality and synchronise with modern languages.  Read
    more in [Extensions](<pldoc/man?section=extensions>) and
    [Directions](</Directions.html>)

### Portability

    * *Portable* to many platforms, including almost all *|Unix/Linux|*
    platforms, *Windows*, *|MacOS X|* (using Xquartz for graphics)
    __WebAssembly (WASM)__, __Android Termux__ and many more. Both
    __32-bit__ and __64-bit__ hardware is supported. SWI-Prolog has been
    compiled and tested on many CPUs, e.g., x86, x64, SPARC, PowerPC,
    many ARM models. Sources are plain C99, configured automatically
    using CMake (as of version 7.7.20). Support for cross-compilation is
    steadily improving.

    * Machine-independent *|saved-states|* (save on one platform, run
    using the virtual machine of another platform).

    * Regular *|binary distributions|* for Windows (32/64 bits) and
    MacOS X (64 bits)) and PPAs for
    [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) ([stable](https://launchpad.net/~swi-prolog/+archive/stable)
    and [development](https://launchpad.net/~swi-prolog/+archive/devel))

    * Regular distribution of the *full source* packages. The sources are
    also accessible through [[GIT][</git.html>]].
