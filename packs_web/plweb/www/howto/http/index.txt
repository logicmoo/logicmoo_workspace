---+ How to create a web service easily?

Creating web services with SWI-Prolog is a breeze. This how-to is
intended as your first bluffer's guide.  All examples come with
fully operational source code.

Deploying Prolog-based web servers

---++ Example code

We have two servers available with complete source. One is the server
that runs http://www.swi-prolog.org, which can be downloaded through
[[GIT][</git.html>]] from the repository
[[plweb.git][</git/plweb.git>]]. The other is
[[ClioPatria][http://cliopatria.swi-prolog.org/]]. Although ClioPatria
targets semantic web (RDF) applications, it is also useful as a starting
point for general purpose web servers.

Here is a very incomplete selection of functionality that you can find
in these servers:

    * SWI-Prolog.org
	- Call CGI scripts (http_cgi.pl)
	- Autocompletion (autocomplete.pl)
	- PlDoc based wiki processing (wiki.pl, wiki_edit.pl)
	- Stress testing (directory stress)
	- Logfile handling (directory logs)
    * ClioPatria
	- User management, OpenID
	- Extension packs (CPACK)
	- Modular server configuration
	- Server statistics
	- Handle messages from Prolog
	- Lots of RDF stuff


---++ Plans (todo)

    * AJAX interaction (YUI, simple table, tree, N-Queens code?)
    * PWP
    * Logfiles and processing thereof
    * Stress-testing by replaying logfiles
