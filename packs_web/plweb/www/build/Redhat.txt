| Fedora release | 23, 24, 25, 28 |
| RHEL | 5 and 6 |
| CentOS | 5 |
| SWI-Prolog release | 8.0.x and 8.1.x |
| Package page | <http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=485155> |
| Maintainer | Petr Pisar |

## Status

This page was written for SWI-Prolog pre-dating the migration to
the CMake configure and build infrastructure. The page has been updated,
but the details have not been tested. Please report issues.

## Dependencies

Use the following commands to obtain all dependencies for a full build
from source.

```
dnf install \
  cmake \
  ninja-build \
  libunwind \
  gperftools-devel \
  freetype-devel \
  gmp-devel \
  java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel \
  jpackage-utils \
  libICE-devel \
  libjpeg-turbo-devel \
  libSM-devel \
  libX11-devel \
  libXaw-devel \
  libXext-devel \
  libXft-devel \
  libXinerama-devel \
  libXmu-devel \
  libXpm-devel \
  libXrender-devel \
  libXt-devel \
  ncurses-devel \
  openssl-devel \
  pkgconfig \
  readline-devel \
  libedit-devel \
  unixODBC-devel \
  zlib-devel \
  uuid-devel \
  libarchive-devel \
  libyaml-devel
```

The above is tested on Fedora 23, 24 and 25.  On Fedora < 23 the
following may be different:

  - `dnf` was once called `yum`,

  - `uuid-devel` was once called `libossp-uuid-devel`,

  - before `java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel` there was
    `java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel`,

  - `libjpeg-turbo-devel` was once called `libjpeg-devel`.

## Building the RPM

You can build an RPM package  from   the  sources, for example to deploy
locally using the CMake CPack tool. See  `CMAKE.md` in the top directory
of the sources.
