## Getting help, asking questions, solving problems

There are several places you can get help or ask questions
about SWI-Prolog or Prolog programming in general.

    - The list of [[frequently asked questions][</FAQ/>]]

    - [SWI-Prolog Discourse forum](https://swi-prolog.discourse.group)
    (best place to get answered for SWI-Prolog specific questions)

    - StackOverflow questions with these tags:
    [swi-prolog](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/swi-prolog),
    [prolog](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/prolog)
    (best place for issues with class room exercises that are not
    SWI-Prolog specific)

    - The Prolog IRC channel ##prolog has moved to libera.chat (server irc.libera.chat)

    - [SWI-Prolog issue tracker at GitHub](https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/issues/issues)
    (See [reporting a bug](<bug.html>) for guidelines about reporting
     a bug)

It usually takes about one day for a volunteer to reply to your question.
We appreciate your patience.
