Introduction
------------
The tptp2X utility is a multi-functional utility for reformating, transforming,
and generating TPTP problem files. In particular, it
+ Converts from the TPTP format to formats used by existing ATP systems.
+ Applies various transformations to the clauses of TPTP problems.
+ Controls the generation of TPTP problem files from TPTP generator files.

Installation
------------
tptp2X is written in Prolog, and should run on most Prolog systems. It is known
to run on current versions of  Eclipse, SICStus,  SWI, and YAP  Prolog.  Before 
using tptp2X,  it is necessary  to install the  code for the dialect  of Prolog
that is to be used.  Installation of the tptp2X utility requires simple changes
in the tptp2X script,  the tptp2X.config file, and the tptp2X.main file.  These 
changes can be made by  running tptp2X_install,  which will prompt for required 
information.  More information about installing tptp2X can be found in the TPTP 
technical report.

    WARNING:  For historical  reasons TPTP2X  omits  the quotes around  some 
    constants and function  symbols that should  be 'Quoted', e.g., as found
    in PUZ001+2.  I'm really sorry  about this - it's an  artifact of a very 
    generic printing framework that became overloaded when THF formulae came 
    into the TPTP.  Changing it would be a HUGE task, and now there's TPTP4X
    that is better in most respects.

Using tptp2X
------------
The most convenient  way of using the tptp2X utility is  through the tptp2X csh
script. The use of this script is:

   tptp2X -h
or tptp2X <Options> <Files>

where the <Options> are:
    [-q<Level>][-i][-s<Size>][-t<Transform>][-f<Format>][-d<Dir>] 
and the <Files> are specified by a list of file names in a file:
    -l<NamesFile>
or directly on the command line.

A common first use of tptp2X is to convert TPTP problems to another format.  To
convert all  TPTP problems  to another  format,  the use  is tptp2X -f<Format>,
where <Format> is one of kif, leantap, tap,  meteor, mgtp, otter, pttp, setheo,
sprfn,  tptp,  e.g. tptp2X -fotter.  To limit  the conversion  to one  or  more
domains,   the   domain  names   are  specified  after  the   <Format>,   e.g.,
tptp2X -fdfg ALG GRP LDA.
***** If you are a new TPTP user, this is probably the use that you want. *****

The  other tptp2X  script flags  give the  user many  options for  reformating,
transforming,  and generating TPTP problem files.  More information about using
the tptp2X script can be found in the TPTP technical report.
