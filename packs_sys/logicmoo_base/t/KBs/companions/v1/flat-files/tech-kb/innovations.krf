The wheel with 120 teeth at the bottom of the diagram rotates once in 24 hours, and drives everything else.
The wheel with 115 teeth rotates once in 23h 56m 4.12s, only 0.03s longer than the sidereal day, so within one part in 3 million of the correct value, turning the star plate (marked with a star) and driving all the wheels above it.
The wheel with 331 teeth is not circular, but shaped in such a way as to drive an image of the sun with the sun's true equatorial velocity, i.e. automatically compensating for the equation of time. [21]
The moon is represented by a sphere which rotates to show the lunar phases, and whose mean motion is within 1.8 parts per million of the true value.
The nodes of the moon's orbit on the ecliptic are represented by the head and tail of the dragon at the top of the diagram. The accuracy here is only to 1 part in 700 of the known value for the motion of the nodes at the time, but as the period of the nodes is 18.6 years this would hardly have been noticeable.
North interprets a particularly difficult part of the manuscript to mean that there was a black anti-solar disc as well as a solar disc, under which the moon was drawn when it was full and near the nodes. This corresponds to the conditions for a lunar eclipse. Lehr is dubious about the eclipse mechanism, so it is absent from his illustrations.
North believes that eight missing leaves from the manuscript may have concerned gear trains to show planetary motion in some way. His evidence for this seems to be a wishful interpretation of Leland which is not really supported by his own translation.")
