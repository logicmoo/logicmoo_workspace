def: "Progression through the phases of the mitotic cell cycle, the most common eukaryotic cell cycle, which canonically comprises four successive phases called G1, S, G2, and M and includes replication of the genome and the subsequent segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells. In some variant cell cycles nuclear replication or nuclear division may not be followed by cell division, or G1 and G2 phases may be absent." [GOC:mah, ISBN:0815316194, Reactome:69278]
comment: Note that this term should not be confused with 'GO:0140014 ; mitotic nuclear division'. 'GO:0000278 ; mitotic cell cycle represents the entire mitotic cell cycle, while 'GO:0140014 ; mitotic nuclear division' specifically represents the actual nuclear division step of the mitotic cell cycle.

def: "A transcription regulator activity that modulates transcription of gene sets via selective and non-covalent binding to a specific double-stranded genomic DNA sequence (sometimes referred to as a motif) within a cis-regulatory region. Regulatory regions include promoters (proximal and distal) and enhancers. Genes are transcriptional units, and include bacterial operons." [GOC:txnOH-2018]
comment: Usage guidance: Most DNA-binding transcription factors do not have enzymatic activity. The presence of specific DNA-binding domains known to be present in DNA-binding transcription factors (HOX, GATA etc) should be used to help decide whether a protein is a DNA binding transcription factor or a coregulator. If a protein has an enzymatic activity (for example, ubiquitin ligase, histone acetyl transferase) and no known DNA binding domain, consider annotating to GO:0003712 transcription coregulator activity. Special care should be taken with proteins containing zinc fingers, Myb/SANT and ARID domains, since only a subset of proteins containing these domains directly and selectively bind to regulatory DNA motifs in cis-regulatory regions.

def: "A transcription regulator activity that modulates the transcription of specific gene sets via binding to a DNA-bound DNA-binding transcription factor, either on its own or as part of a complex. Coregulators often act by altering chromatin structure and modifications. For example, one class of transcription coregulators modifies chromatin structure through covalent modification of histones. A second class remodels the conformation of chromatin in an ATP-dependent fashion. A third class modulates interactions of DNA-bound DNA-binding transcription factors with other transcription coregulators." [GOC:txnOH-2018, PMID:10213677, PMID:16858867, PMID:24203923, PMID:25957681, Wikipedia:Transcription_coregulator]
comment: Usage guidance: Most transcription coregulators do not bind DNA. Those that do usually bind DNA either in a non-specific or non-direct manner. If a protein binds DNA specifically, consider annotating to GO:0003700 DNA binding transcription factor activity.

def: "A small, dense body one or more of which are present in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It is rich in RNA and protein, is not bounded by a limiting membrane, and is not seen during mitosis. Its prime function is the transcription of the nucleolar DNA into 45S ribosomal-precursor RNA, the processing of this RNA into 5.8S, 18S, and 28S components of ribosomal RNA, and the association of these components with 5S RNA and proteins synthesized outside the nucleolus. This association results in the formation of ribonucleoprotein precursors; these pass into the cytoplasm and mature into the 40S and 60S subunits of the ribosome." [ISBN:0198506732]

To annotate gene products located in these mitochondrial relics in species such as Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis or others, please use GO:0032047 'mitosome' or GO:0042566 'hydrogenosome'.

The Golgi apparatus operates at the intersection of the secretory, lysosomal, and endocytic pathways." [ISBN:0198506732]
comment: Note that the Golgi apparatus can be located in various places in the cytoplasm. In plants and lower animal cells, the Golgi apparatus exists as many copies of discrete stacks dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, while the Golgi apparatus of interphase mammalian cells is a juxtanuclear, often pericentriolar reticulum, where the discrete Golgi stacks are stitched together to form a compact and interconnected ribbon, sometimes called the Golgi ribbon.

def: "A specialized eukaryotic organelle that consists of a filiform extrusion of the cell surface and of some cytoplasmic parts.

[GOC:cilia, GOC:curators, GOC:kmv, GOC:vw, ISBN:0198547684, PMID:16824949, PMID:17009929, PMID:20144998]
comment: Note that we deem cilium and microtubule-based flagellum to be equivalent. In most eukaryotic species, intracellular sub-components of the cilium, such as the ciliary base and rootlet, are located near the plasma membrane. In Diplomonads such as Giardia, instead, the same ciliary parts are located further intracellularly. Also, 'cilium' may be used when axonemal structure and/or motility are unknown, or when axonemal structure is unusual. For all other cases, please refer to children of 'cilium'. Finally, note that any role of ciliary proteins in sensory events should be captured by annotating to relevant biological process terms.

comment: Note that this term should be used to annotate gene products in the organism undergoing the programmed cell death. To annotate genes in another organism whose products modulate programmed cell death in a host organism, consider the term 'modulation by symbiont of host programmed cell death ; GO:0052040'. Also, note that 'programmed cell death ; GO:0012501' should be used to refer to instances of caspase-independent cell death mechanisms, in the absence of further indications on the process taking place. At present, caspase-independent cell death is not yet represented in GO due to the lack of consensus and in-depth research on the topic. 'programmed cell death ; GO:0012501' may also be used to annotate gene products in taxa where apoptosis as defined in GO:0006915 does not occur, such as plants. You may also consider these specific children: GO:0097468 'programmed cell death in response to reactive oxygen species' (with descendants GO:0010421 'hydrogen peroxide-mediated programmed cell death' and GO:0010343 'singlet oxygen-mediated programmed cell death'), and GO:0009626 'plant-type hypersensitive response' and its children.

name: general transcription initiation factor activity
namespace: molecular_function
def: "A molecular function required for core promoter activity that mediates the assembly of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme at promoter DNA to form the pre-initiation complex (PIC). General transcription factors (GTFs) bind to and open promoter DNA, initiate RNA synthesis and stimulate the escape of the polymerase from the promoter. Not all subunits of the general transcription factor are necessarily present at all promoters to initiate transcription. GTFs act at each promoter, although the exact subunit composition at individual promoters may vary." [GOC:txnOH-2018]
comment: Usage guidance: The distinction between general transcription factors and DNA-binding transcription factors is that the latter modulate the selection of which genes are expressed under specific conditions, while general transcription factors are the constitutive machinery required for transcription initiation.
