Here is a sample of the sentences which NSM-DALIA can parse.
This file is also an example of NSM input files.

It's a simple text file with tags added.

The tag @p at the beginning of a line causes all the following text to be parsed.
The text to be parsed is not in NSM format: sentences are ended by fullstops, and indentation
is not significative.

The tag @e at the beginning of a line stops the parsing mode: the text following that tag is 
simply output how it is.


A minimal NSM sentence has the structure "Substantive Phrase + Predicate Phrase:"
