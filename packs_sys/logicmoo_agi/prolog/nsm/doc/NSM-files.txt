			NSM INPUT FILES

An NSM input file is a text file, with some special tags which show to
NSM-DALIA what to do.

When NSM-DALIA parses such a file, it works in normal file-reading
mode (simply outputting each character found), until a tag is
encountered at the beginning of a new line. Tags begin with a "@"
character, followed by a letter. Tags are case-sensitive, so @p and @P
are different commands!

If you write an NSM input file with a word processor (instead of a
text editor), you will have to save your file in pure text format
(".txt"), ANSI-encoded (NOT unicode or UTF8. Support for such
encodings will be hopefully made available in later versions).

Here is a quick tour of the main tags implemented so far. Other will
be made available as the program is developed.

1.
@p
Following text is split into sentences (fullstop-separated), parsed
and transformed into NSM-PROLOG notation, until an @e tag is
found. Then, normal file-reading mode is resumed. You will find many
example of how this works in the "sentences.txt" file, in the demo
directory. See what happens when you run a pf("demo/sentences.txt")
command in NSM-DALIA: the sentences between a @p ... @e block are
replaced (in the output) by their NSM-PROLOG analysis, while all the
text outside such blocks is output as it is. Please note that the text
in a @p .. @e block is NOT in NSM format, but sentences must be
fullstop-separated, and indentation plays no role.

2.
@P
Text in a @P ... @e block is considered to be in NSM- standard
format. See examples of this in the "texts.txt" file, in the "demo"
directory. The NSM standard format uses newline as sentence separator,
no punctuation, and indentation as a means of showing quotation. If
you want to split a long line, but you want the parser to consider the
new line as a continuation of the previous sentence, put a "/" or a
"\" at the end of the first part, and indentation and newline will be
not considered. Ex. in the following text, all indentations and
newlines are significative:

this person thinks like this
    these people are not people like me
    these people are bad people
  
But you can also write it like this:

this person thinks like this
    these people \
            are not people like me
    these people \
            are bad people


3.
@t
Text in a @t ... @e block is translated from current_language NSM into
curernt_l2 NSM. If current_language and current_l2 are the same, text
is not first parsed and then re-generated in the same language, but
simply output as it is. Text is in normal format, with fullstops
showing sentence boundaries.


4.
@T
As before, but this time, text must be in NSM standard format.


5.  
@g 
Text in a "@g ... end." block is read as NSM-PROLOG formulas, and
replaced by its equivalent in the target language. Note that this
block is ended by an "end." tag (with fullstop!), and not by the usual
"@e" tag. If generation fails for some reason, the formula is output
unchanged. You can see how this and the following tag work by making
NSM-DALIA parse the file "text-gen.txt", in the "demo" directory. Text
is in normal format.


6.
@G
As before, but with text in NSM standard format. The end of the block
is given by and "end." command (with fullstop), instead of the usual
"@e" tag.


7.
@@
This lets you write a "@" character at the beginning of a line
(writing a simple "@" in that position would start a tag-recognition
process).
