# Narsese on Prolog (NP)

This is a SWI-Prolog pack that runs Narsese like AGI

AGI for Prolog is a completely new platform and not branched from the existing AGI codebase. The Narsese in Prolog (NP) system takes the logic and conceptual ideas of AGI, and will be doing event handling and procedural learning much like ANSNA.

# Not _obligated_ to maintain a git fork just to contribute

Dislike having tons of forks that are several commits behind the main git repo?

Be old school - Please ask to be added to logicmoo and Contribute directly !

Still, we wont stop you from doing it the Fork+PullRequest method
