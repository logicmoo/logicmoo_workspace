h1. Direct semantics for defeasible theories

h2. An implementation in (disjunctive) answer set programming

h3. Contents

The implementation consists of three ASP encodings:

* stable_sets.lp implementing the stable-set semantics
* possible_sets.lp implementing the possible-set semantics
* derivations.lp for computing all possible derivations from a given defeasible theory

h3. Input syntax

An input defeasible theory is encoded as a logic program.

* Defeasible theories are specified by giving for each rule a head literal and body literals.
* A literal is either positive (a term) or negative (neg(T) where T is a term).
* Rules are represented by terms.
* To say that a literal L is the head of a rule R, use head(R, L).
* To say that a literal L occurs in the body of a rule R, use body(R, L).
* A rule is considered strict unless specified otherwise.
* To say that a rule R is defeasible, use def(R).

h3. Usage

* To compute the stable sets of a defeasible theories encoded in a file theory.lp, call clingo with both encodings:

** clingo 0 stable_sets.lp theory.lp

* To compute the possible sets of a defeasible theory, do likewise:

** clingo 0 possible_sets.lp theory.lp

* The same holds for computing all derivations of a defeasible theory:

** clingo 0 derivations.lp theory.lp
