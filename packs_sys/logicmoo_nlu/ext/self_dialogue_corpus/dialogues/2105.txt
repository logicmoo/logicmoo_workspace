Why were the Bears so bad last year?
Well, they had a ton of injuries on defense to start with.
Right. They lost Danny Trevathon and Pernell McFee and those guys were suposed to be the heart of the defense.
Don't forget that they lost Leonard Floyd to concussions.
Floyd. Did you see his interview about how he dealt with the concussions over the off season?
No, how did he manage to recuperate?
I don't think he did, actually. He said that he just sat in his room on his sofa and stared at the TV all day because he couldn't get up to do anything.
Wow, I never have experienced a concussion, so I have no idea how severe the recovery time is.
The scary thing is that research is showing that it's not the big hits that are causing the big damage, but rather the repetitive non-concussive trauma.
You mean all the regular hits that lineman take on every play?
Yes, these repetitive hits accumulate over a lifetime to produce serious damage to the brain.
Well, by the time these kids make it to the NFL, they've played and practiced hundreds if not thousands of hits already.
That really is scary. I kind of feel guilty enjoying a game where these guys are permanently hurting themselves.
Me too. I love a good hit as much as the next guy, but the reality is that this is a very violent sport.
What can they do to address the concussion issue?
Well, they have been expanding the "concussion protocol" where a doctor is required to be on the field and able to administer a battery of tests to a potentially concussed player.
I meant: will they change the game so that there are less hits during gameplay?
For sure. I think that they changed the kick-off distance for exactly that reason.
I played football all the way through high school, but I don't think I want my sons playing when they get older.
I agree, With this concussion issue gathering more data about health implications, there's no way I will let my kids play football, unfortunately.
