What's the most outrageous stunt featuring a car in the Fast & the Furious movies?
I would have to say when Paul Walker and Vin Diseal drove the supercar between the Etihad Towers in Abu Dhabi.
I was almost postivie you were going to say the bank vault scene!
What Fast movie was that in? I get them all mixed up now since there are so many.
The bank vault chase was in Fast 5, released in 2011.
Didn't Brian and Dom drag that entire bank vault down the streets of Rio de Janeiro?
Yes that's the scene! I think the craziest car scene was in 2 Fast 2 Furious, the first race when Brain jumped over the draw bridge in his car.
That scene still gives me chills when I watch it. The cinematography makes the viewer feel the adrenaline that the racers are feeling all the way up until the end.
I think you can say that about any of the Fast & the Furious movies. Each film is adrenaline packed to the core.
Oh but what about that tank car chase in Fast & Furious 6? That was the most adrenaline packed scene in the entire series in my opinion.
