What makes the Beatles music part of the British Invasion?
Well, a turnabout concept, since they were fans of American rock and roll.
Who were they fans of before they became world famous?
The Everly Brothers, Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Little Richard and other American acts.
In their earlier songs the Beatles patterned their harmony like the Everly Brothers.
That was an accomplishment considering none of the Beatles were known to be related to each other.
Please, Please Me was influenced by the vocals in Cathy's Clown.
Some of the musical chords were influenced by the same song as well.
The Beatles early on referred to themselves as the Four Everlys.
Yes. They were influenced by the Everly Brothers almost as much as Simon and Garfunkel were.
