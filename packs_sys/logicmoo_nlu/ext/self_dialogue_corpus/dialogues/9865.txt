Do you have a favorite hip-hop artist that haven't made it big in the mainstream yet?
Yeah, one of them is that boy Grafh from Queens.
I never heard of him. Does he have an album i could listen to online?
He has plenty of work online. Try Pain Killers and Pain Killers Reloaded.
I'm a check him out on my free time. You ever heard of Nino Man?
Yeah, i heard him on Hot 97 with Funk Master Flex.
He rapped his heart out that day on the radio.
Yeah he did for sure. Hope he gets to drop a mainstream album soon.
He is working with Jadakiss so hopefully he could get his foot in the door.
Nino Man just released a mixtape a few days ago called Better Late Than Never. It has some nice tracks on it.
