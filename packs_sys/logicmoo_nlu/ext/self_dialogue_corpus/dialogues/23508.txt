So, what do you think?  Have we pretty much kick the horse dead on bad covers?
i don't know, I might be able to squeeze out a few more.
Oh, dear god, no..
Yes, yes, I think I can.  Check it: "Sweet Child O'Mine" by Sheryl Crow
Oh, wow, yeah, I remember that one.. it was on that Adam Sandler movie uh... shoot, can't remember which-
Big Daddy.
Yeah, that was it! Totally terrible. I mean, if you're gonna take a CLASSIC song like that and try to make it new, you'd better have something awesome to bring to the table.
I agree.  Oh, neat little bit of trivia about that song though.
What's that?
Well, among other things it wasn't really meant to be a song.
What do you mean?
Well, check it out, you know that guitar riff in the beginning?  That's called "Playing the scales."  You'll notice it's the same beat over and over just keeps increasing on the pitch.
Huh.
Yeah, Slash was practicing on that one day and someone's like, "Hey, this sounds really cool, let's put it as an intro to a song."  So they built some lyrics around it.
I did not know that.
Another neat fact, near the end of the song they didn't have another verse to end the song with so, Axel is just literally saying, "Where do we go now?" over and over again.
Wow... mind blown.
Now, this part I can't confirm, I think GNR was a bit surprised that that song became such a hit.
Well, regardless how it came about, I think it's a really song.
I do too.  Although crazily enough, as a younger man I thought he was singing about his kid.  Guess I took things too literally back then.
