What do you think the next Fast & Furious movie will be about?
I didn't realize there were going to be more.
There are.  Number nine and ten are already planned.
It is tough to say.  How are they going to top the flying car landing from Seven, or the submarine from Eight?
To be honest, it seems like the logical progression would be something in space.
As absurd as it sounds, I would not put it past this franchise.
Especially because no matter how outlandish it seems to get, they keep making money.
Do you know how much they made with 'Fate of the Furious?'
I believe it grossed $1.23 billion.
In other words, they will keep raising the stakes for the main characters because there is such a high demand for these movies.
