Did you like The Force Awakens?
Yes, but I liked Rogue One Better.
Yeah, it was good, especially how they maanged to incorporate Moff Tarkin into it.
Yeah, the actor got Peter Cushing's mannet down very well, and the CGI did wonders superimposing his face on to him.
Personally, I though they could have given a bit more to Princess Leia, but what they did do was pretty good.
Did you like the ending?
It was okay, but I'd have liked Cassian and Jyn to have survived.
That would have been okay, but you have to admit the the Darth Vader comabt scene was great.
It was, if fact it showed you why Darth Vader is such a feared figure in the Star Wars Universe.
It did do that, and it was an awesome scene.
