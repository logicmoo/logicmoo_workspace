Do you like when the Beatles cover other artists' songs?
Oh yeah, it's great to hear their spin on things.
I've been listening a lot to "Twist and Shout," because it's so upbeat.
Yes, that song puts you into a good mood no matter what.
Last week I was playing "Roll Over Beethoven" and I think I like it better than the Chuck Berry version.
I love Chuck Berry, so I don't know if I can say that, but The Beatles did a great job with it.
Then you have all the covers that have been done on Beatles' songs over the years.
There is too many to count, that would take years.
I used to like Aerosmith's version of "I am the Walrus," but I wore it out by listening to it too much.
That's a good one, but I think Frank Sinatra's cover of "Something" is superior.
