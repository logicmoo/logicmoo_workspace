What do you think was the best move this off season?
I think Marshawn Lynch coming back and going to the Raiders is a big deal.
Really, he is kind of up there in age, I don't know how productive he will be.
He should do well, he took time off after all.
I see, so you're saying he should be rejuvenated for the coming season.
Yes, I think he has taken the time to get healthy.
I really also want to see how Adrian Peterson does on the Saints.
Yes I wonder if he can have a good season, the Saints are an explosive offense.
Yes, if he can play the whole season I think he will perform well.
Speaking of a former Viking, how well do you think Minnesota will be.
Good question, I think they will miss the playoffs because the Packers and Lions will both be good.
Yes, I agree with that, it will be tough to win that division this year.
Well at least they have a good young core.
Yup, they just need to find that franchise quarterback to lead them to the promised land.
I do wonder though how the Vikings will be without Adrian Peterson, it's kind of crazy not seeing him in that uniform.
Well I don't think they were on the best terms, it will be strange if they Saints and Vikings play for sure.
Yes that is true.
Well hopefully he can earn me some Fantasy points as a dark horse, I am willing to bet on Peterson.
Good luck, that can payoff if he goes off for some good numbers.
Yup, well either way this season's going to be great.
