Do you think it's weird that a lightsaber training device just happened to aboard the Millennium Falcon in Ep. 4?
That floating orb that popped Luke a couple of times?
Yeah man, Han says that he doesn't believe in the force yet this device just happens to be on the ship.
Maybe it was a leftover relic from a smuggling operation.
You know that could be. I never thought about that.
Is there a mandatory sentence minimum for Star Wars smugglers?
I bet it depends on the cargo.
Is there an Imperial jail somewhere? Now that is something I would like to see.
If you think about it the Death Star is like a flying jail. I mean where are you going to go?
I guess Vader was the first Imperial jail warden.
