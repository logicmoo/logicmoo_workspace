I wanted to watch something good and scary, but not gore focused.
You could watch something based on Stephen King's work.
Oh! Good idea! Which one?
You could watch Carrie. It is more of a thriller than a true horror.
That sounds like a good one. Who made that one?
Brian De Palma directed Carrie.
Great. I love his work that I've seen before.
Carrie also has some spectacular editing. You're in for a treat with the ending of that film!
I really appreciate the recommendation. I'd love to see that one on the big screen.
Yeah, I know. That finale would be breathtaking in a theater.
