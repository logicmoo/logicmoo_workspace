I love the Star Wars movies. Would you also consider yourself a fan?
Absolutely and I love all of the movies. Do you have a favorite?
I would have to say Empire Strikes Back. I just think it was the best all around.
Empire is actually my second pick, next to Return of the Jedi.
Not a bad choice, but what makes Return of the Jedi number one in your eyes?
I think Jedi was just a great way to close the saga, we got to see the return of Anakin, and the acting was completely on par.
While I do not disagree, I just feel Empire Strikes Back gave the fans more of what they wanted. It had a little bit of everything.
I do not disagree with that one bit, but I just feel it's so popular because of the big "Father bombshell."
I suppose we can agree to disagree in a friendly way.
Of course. Despite our favorite being a little different, neither of us can disagree on the fact that Star Wars overall is an amazing film series.
