Are you going to see Iron Maiden in Brooklyn in July?
I really wanted to go, but in the end, I decided not to.
What? I thought you were the ultimate Iron Maiden fan! How can you not go?
I heard they were only playing songs off the new album. They're not playing ANY of the old classics!
Woah, are you serious? How can that be? Fans want to hear the classic songs from all the old albums.
Exactly! I want to hear songs from Powerslave, The Number of the Beast, Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. The new material can't compare to the great songs they played while I was growing up.
I wonder why they would do that...
I guess they only play the old songs on the tours between albums.
That's really dumb if you ask me. They should at least play a mix of old and new songs.
I agree. Somebody should tell that to the band!
So I noticed you only mentioned you wanted to hear albums with songs that have Bruce Dickinson on vocals. What about the first two albums?
To be honest, I'm really not crazy about the albums with Paul Di'anno on vocals.
That's blasphemy! Why not?
He's an inferior vocalist to Dickinson. As was Blaze Bayley in the other albums I didn't mention.
You mean to say you don't like Di'anno's songs like Charlotte the Harlot? Those are cult classics too!
Yes, but when you hear Dickinson do his versions of those songs in concert, the difference is tremendous.
Well I have to agree with you that Dickinson is the better vocalist, but you have to respect Paul Di'anno.
I didn't say I didn't respect him. I just said I didn't really like his vocal performance.
Anyway, Are you sure you don't want to go to the concert?
Yes, I think I'll sit this one out and wait for a tour where they play the old songs!
