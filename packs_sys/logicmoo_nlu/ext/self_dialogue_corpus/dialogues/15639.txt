What is your favorite genre of music?
I like many different genres, but hard rock is probably my favorite.
Who are some of your favorite bands?
Some of my all-time favorites are Queens of the Stone Age, Muse, and Nirvana.
If you like them, I think you'd really like Royal Blood.
Oh, I haven't heard of them. What are they like?
They're a newer hard rock two-piece from the UK. They're very heavy, comparable to Queens of the Stone Age.
Awesome, I always love hearing new music. What should I start with from their discography?
Well, they only have two albums out, but both are really good. I'd start with the first and then listen the new album.
Oh, when did the new album come out?
Royal Blood's new album just came out this month, on June 16th. It's called "How Did We Get So Dark?"
Great, I look forward to hearing it. Have you heard of Death From Above 1979?
Yes, I love that band.
I know, right? Another great, heavy two-piece.
I heard they're changing their name back to just Death From Above.
Oh, they're dropping the "1979" part of the name?
Yes, they are. They changed it originally due a legal dispute with Death From Above Records, but it's water under the bridge now.
Oh, cool. Death From Above definitely rolls off the tongue easier, more memorable too.
I agree. I'm so glad they're back together again.
I know, me too! I definitely plan to see them the next time they come through town.
