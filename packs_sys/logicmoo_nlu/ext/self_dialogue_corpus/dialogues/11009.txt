I'm confused about how a player can stay onside or be offside.
To be onside, a player on offense can only completely enter the other team's zone after the puck has crossed into the zone.
How do you know when the puck is in other other team's zone.
There is a blue line on the ice that borders that zone.
I've seen two blue lines in each rink.
Yes, one bordering each team's zone, and in between is neutral ice that belongs to neither team.
Can an offensive player partially cross into the other team's zone before the puck?
Yes, but they have to keep some part of their body, like their skate for example, behind the blue line until the puck crosses.
That's interesting. That keeps them from having too much advantage, it sounds like.
Yeah. Any number of defensive players can already be in that zone before that puck crosses.
I'm also confused about how the points are scored.
Well, there are goals, of course, that count towards the score of the game.
True, but I've heard that assists also count toward a player's points.
Yes, but not towards the score of the team, so they don't determine wins or losses.
So how does the point system work?
Well, there is only one goal per scoring play, but there can be up to two assists.
I know the person who gets the puck in the net scores the goal, but who scores the assist?
The one or two players who touch the puck before the goal scorer and set the goal scorer up to score.
So, in theory, there could be twice as many assists as goals scored.
Yes, but sometimes a goal is scored with one or even no assists.
