I'm in the mood for a good thriller movie. Have you seen any lately?
I actually haven't seen any lately, but a few I've seen in the past and liked are Gone Girl, Silence of the Lambs, The Sixth Sense, and Memento.
I've seen all of those except Memento. Is it worth watching?
Definitely. It's really original and keeps you guessing.
I've heard of it but can't remember who's in it.
Guy Pearce, who's very good in it, Joe Pantoliano, and Carrie Ann Moss.
I like Guy. He was in a couple of the Alien movies.
Yep, that's him. It's good in a way that you didn't see it in the theater because it's a little hard to follow in spots, and if you watch it on DVD or online, you'll be able to rewind and watch parts of it over again.
Great, sounds intriging.
I remember when I saw it I was very impressed with the uniqueness of it and I really like the story. It's also filmed in a unique way, but I don't want to give too much away!
