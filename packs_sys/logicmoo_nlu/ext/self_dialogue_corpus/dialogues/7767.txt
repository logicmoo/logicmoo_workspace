What's your favorite part of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone?
I like at the end when they're playing on the giant chess board.
I agree. I also like when they have to get past Fluffy, the three-headed guard dog.
I love the whole ending scene of the movie because it shows how well Harry, Ron and Hermione can work together.
What's your least favorite part of the movie?
I don't like when Harry is in the Forbidden Forest and sees somebody drinking the Unicorn's blood.
Don't we later figure out that Professor Quirrell is drinking the blood to sustain Voldemort?
Yes, that's right. That part of the movie always used to scare me.
When I was younger, the part of the movie that scared me was when Hagrid got to the island where Harry was staying with the Dursleys to tell him he was a wizard.
I love when all of the letters come to Harry's house. I always thought it was funny that he tried to jump and catch one instead of grabbing one off of the floor.
