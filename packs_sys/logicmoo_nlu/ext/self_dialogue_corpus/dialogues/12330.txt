I always thought Carrie Fisher was beautiful, but I really loved seeing her blossom as the original trilogy progressed.
Yes, she had a young fresh beauty - and a lot of sass, of course - in Star Wars, and then she just got better.
Of course she had better hair after Star Wars, ha. The double bun is iconic and distinctive, but the braids wound around her head were a lot more attractive.
As you watch, you keep being reminded how tiny she was. She was small next to Harrison Ford, and she was just dwarfed next to Peter Mayhew, who played Chewie.
Everyone was dwarfed next to Peter Mayhew.
The scenes between her and Darth Vader, black vs white, good vs evil, tall vs tiny, were very dramatic.
I thought she was her most beautiful in Return of the Jedi. Great costuming.
Are you talking about the slave outfit Leia wore when she was with Jabba the Hutt?
Well sure, she looked amazing in that. But even the workday uniform she wore on the Ewok planet was really nice. And the scenes with her long, long hair all loose, just beautiful.
I'm so sorry she's gone, but it's great that we have these films to remember her by.
