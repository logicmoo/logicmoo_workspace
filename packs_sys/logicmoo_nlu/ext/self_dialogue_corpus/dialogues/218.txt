What did you think about the new Wonder Woman movie?
I thought it was excellent! It was definitely one of my top two superhero movies this year.
Mine too, I think I liked it as much as Logan.
Definitely right there with Logan for me. The way Patty Jenkins the director portrayed Diana as Wonder Woman was better than I expected.
She really did a fantastic job, and Gal Gadot was the perfect Wonder Woman. I liked how they portrayed her as a strong female without having to dump on the male characters.
That was probably one of the best aspects of it. We're so use to empowerment by making the opposite look weaker or foolish, but here they struck such a good balance with the thematic ideas.
The action, the humor, the heart! Boy did this movie have heart! I really cared for all the characters.
Chris Pine was really good in this role. It seem like he was going to be in a similar position of character as in Star Trek with his Captain Kirk, but they developed his character really well.
What did you think about the action sequences?
I thought they were great! In an action superhero movie of this caliber you need the pay off, and they certainly delivered with it. The build up to the final showdown was well worth waiting for.
