Have you listened to the band City and Colour?
No, I haven't heard them. What are they like?
It's Dallas Green who was in Alexisonfire. This is his solo project.
I remember Alexisonfire! Is it the same type of music?
No, it's really acoustic, almost like folk music. His voice is beautiful and his songwriting makes me cry. The album "The Hurry and the Harm" is my favorite.
Really? I thought you liked metal music.
I do, but my boyfriend loves City and Colour so I started listening to them. I've started listening to some other bands like that. Have you heard of This Wild Life?
No, I haven't heard of them either. Would I have heard any of their songs?
They did a cover of "Sleepwalking" that was really good. They're just two guys who play the guitar and sing. It's really different than the normal stuff I listen to.
You know who I saw and I checked out their stuff and it's really good? Have you heard of Avatar?
Yes! I love Avatar! What song is your favorite?
I love that song "Let It Burn" from their Black Waltz album. It's really upbeat but still heavy.
That song is great. Have you listened to their new album Feathers and Flesh?
Yes, that's the first one I listened to. What was the album before that one?
Hail the Apocalypse. That single was good but I wasn't crazy about the rest of the album.
I'll have to listen to it. I like that swedish metal music. Have you listened to In Flames?
Yes, I love them! I like Amaranthe too. I think I want to go to Sweden just to listen to metal music.
Who is Amaranthe? Are they Swedish too?
Yeah, they have three vocalists..a girl and guy singer and a screamer so it's a different sound than what everyone else is doing.
Really? I'll have to check them out. I like stuff like that.
