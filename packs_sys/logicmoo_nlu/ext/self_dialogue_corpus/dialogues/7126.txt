I heard your son dressed up as Woody from Toy Story.
Yeah, he looked adorable.
He was missing his best pal though, Buzz Lightyear.  Don't they become friends at the end of the movie?
They do, and we tried to get his friend to dress up as Buzz, but it didn't happen.
That's too bad.
He even had a fake snake in his boot.
Why?
Because Woody would always say, "There's a Snake in My Boot!"
I remember that now,  and "Reach for the Skies."
Yeah, Woody had a lot of great sayings.
