Do you like John Mellencamp?
I do, but it's not without reservations.
What do you mean?
He writes some incredibly good songs that I love deep down inside, but he's really hit and miss.
So what do you do, just listen to greatest hits compilations?
No, my choices don't match up very well with theirs. I have an iTunes playlist that I made of my favorite songs by him.
Good idea. If I wasn't so lazy, I could do that with a few different artists that I feel that way about.
I recommend it. You know, there's a funny thing about him --
Please don't tell me that story about when your sister's friend met him AGAIN.
No, no. I was going to say that it seems like his music matures almost in sync with me. He grows and changes just when I do.
Hmm. Well, I guess I kind of see what you mean. I can't listen to anything before Scarecrow without it being a pure nostalgia trip.
Yep, me too. And Scarecrow is starting to go that way for me now.
Favorite album from him? Mine's Human Wheels.
I guess Mr. Happy Go Lucky, but it's a little hard to day because even that one only has so many I songs on it that I like.
I love that song Empty Hands. In a way it could be heard as a Christmas song,  but it's really so much more.
Agreed. It's excellent. And it shows something about him which I love, his concern and support for the common people.
True, true. Farm Aid and all.
Right. I think they still do that.
Me too. But I don't like to think too much about his personal life.
Oh, I agree. All that smoking and so many marriages.
