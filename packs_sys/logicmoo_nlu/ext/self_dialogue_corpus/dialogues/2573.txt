Hey man! Did you see where the Jacksonville Jaguars signed Tim Tebow to replace Bortles?
What?! What are you talking about?  They did not!
Haha! Naw, they didnt! I'm just messing with you.  But they should have.  Jacksonville I'd going to bad again this year.
Ha! Quite true. They will be the worst team in the NFLs worst division if you ask me.
Yeah, the Jags, Colts, Texans, and the Titans. Who do you see winning that division?
Well starting at the bottom, as I said will be Jacksonville.
And working your way up?
Argh! It's tough. I'm torn between Houston and Indy.
What? You don't trust Andrew Luck?
Oh I trust him! But he has absolutely nothing to work with!
That's true.it's such a shame to see him wasting away there. Imagine him with Houston or Denver!
He is one of the very best and is being wasted. I think Deshon Watson will start early and lead Houston to 9-7 and a potential playoff spot.
Interesting. You think he's already ready?
I do. Out of Watson , Trubisky, and Mahonnes, I think Watson will prove to be the most field ready
Yeah but our boy Mahonnes in KC will be the first to win a Superbowl! !!
Word! But not this year. He will lead KC to glory in a about 3 years.
Well, who is going to win it all this year?
Calm down. I'm getting there. The team that will lose the Superbowl this year is the Tennessee Titans.
Wow! You think they will make it that far?
I do. It's Marcus Marriotas 3rd year, and the have made all the right off season moves. They will make it only to lose to...the Green Bay Packers
