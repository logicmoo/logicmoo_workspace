Hey what's your favorite Star Wars movie out of all of them?
Including the new ones, you mean? I think Empire Strikes back is the best, but I can't really pick a favorite
As strange as it sounds, I think I liked Revenge of the Sith the best
Really? Everyone says the prequel movies were really bad
They weren't perfect, but I think Episode III wrapped up that part of the story really well. And it led into the original trilogy, so you saw some of the same characters.
Oh yeah, did you see Joel Edgerton as Uncle Owen? Too bad that wasn't a bigger role because I like him as an actor
Maybe if they make an Obi-Wan movie they will have Joel Edgerton come back as Uncle Owen
That would be a great idea. I heard that one of the books had Darth Maul come back and attach Obi-Wan near Owen's home or something
That's awesome, but I also heard that the books don't really have anything to do with the movies.
Now that Disney owns Lucasfilm, they're more willing to take risks with the stories. Here's hoping they give this storyline a chance!
