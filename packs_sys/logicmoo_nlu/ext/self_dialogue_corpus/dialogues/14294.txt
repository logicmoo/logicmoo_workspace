Basketball was my favorite sport as a kid. I loved the Celtics of the 1980s.
Larry bird was by far my favorite player. I was a teen when he was in his prime as a player.
I kind of missed out on the 1981 championship as I was only 7. But I remeber the 1984 and 1986 championships very well.
It was such a memorable time and team. I will never forget it.
My father and I used to watch the games together. My father was one heck of a basketnball player.
I remember one time I watched him play at South High in Worcester, Mass in a pickup game/
He went back and forth with a player who was black. He called himself Larry bird. The other player called himself Magic Johnson
It was fun to watch. Something I will never forget as long as I live.
As I got older, Larry Bird became more injury prone and older. 1st the Lakers became the better team, then the Pistons.
And MJ AND THE bULLS WERE WAITING IN THE WING as well. It was an exciting time to be a basketball fan.
At the same time, I played alot of basketball and became a good player myself. I was an all-star.
I was really good in junior high. But by the time high school rolled around I had lost my motivation  a bit.
I was out of shape and gained some weight. But I continued to play in high school.
It wasn't until my senior year that I made the varisty team. I wore my father's number to honor him.
Even though I did not play much and was not that successful, I still had alot of fun.
I wish I had staye din better shape as I look back at my life. But I have always had my weight issues.
Still, basketball, and the NBA, is something I love. But it isn't the same as it was in the 80s.
Larry Bird is an all-time great. Probably in the top 5-10 all-time players.
Injuries cut back on his career though. It was because he played so hard.
That was sad to see but it was a by-product of how hard he played the game.
