Okay, now it's your turn... what are some covers YOU like?
Well, let's see... I liked Twist and Shout by The Beatles.
What, that was a cover?
Yeah, the original was done by the Isley Brothers like a few decades before... can't remember exactly.
Oh wow... I remember hearing that song I think for the first time in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
HAHA!  Yeah, I remember that scene.  Not the first time I heard it, but it's definitely a memorable moment of the film.
Come, give me some more.
Well... "Cum On Feel the Noise" by Quiet Riot
Wait.. no way, that was a cover too?
Yeah, it was originally done by a different group.
You're blowing me away with all these neat facts.
Yeah, the original is a lot more mellow though, has this older style, more seventiesish.
Seventiesish?
Yeah, yeah, I know, that's note a word, but still, I think you understand what I mean.
Come to think of it, wasn't Quiet Riot like one of these first hair metal bands of the 80s?
Yeah, them and Twisted Sister.  You could really argue those two pretty much started the whole "hair metal" band trend.
I think it's crazy so many people today like to deny they ever listened to that music growing up
Well, you know, to paraphrase Heart Shaped Box "More people didn't like the music than did.  That's kind of the point."
HAHA.
Plus there's always a bit of backlash against whatever's popular.  I think that's true of any age.
