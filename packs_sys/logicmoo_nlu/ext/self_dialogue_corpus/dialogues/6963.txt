Did you ever see the classic Disney Cinderella?
Yeah, I used to watch it all the time as a kid.
Me too. It was one of my favorites until recently.
What do you mean?
Well, I watched it again a few weeks ago, and it dawned on me how many negative messages about women are in that movie.
Wow, I guess you're probably right. I never thought about it.
Neither did I. But the whole point of the movie is that this girl is beautiful and graceful enough for a guy to save her from her life.
Yeah. Like her life wouldn't have been intrinsically valuable had she not been this great beauty.
Exactly. And the only way she could escape her terrible situation was to make a wish for someone else to save her.
We've really come a long way in a short time.
