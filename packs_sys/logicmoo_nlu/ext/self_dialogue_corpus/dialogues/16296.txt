Been to any good concerts recently?
Yeah man, we saw The Joy Formidable the other night. They were really good.
Never heard of them, what are they like?
They're a three-piece band from Wales. They're pretty heavy, but very melodic. Female singer.
Sort of like Paramore?
No, not really. More like a less grandiose version of Muse.
I used to love Muse for their first few albums.
Man, me too. I don't know if they changed too much or if I did, but I can barely listen to them anymore.
Weird then that you're really into this other band that sounds like them.
Ha, maybe, although I think The Joy Formidable takes the best parts of Muse and strips out the stuff that I came to not like about of them.
I hear you. On a related note, I caught The Flaming Lips the other night at a festival here in town.
No way, how were they? I hear they're crazy live.
Yeah, it was pretty bonkers. The music was OK - I am only really into a couple of their albums - but the show was great.
I would love to see those guys.
What would you say was the best concert you've seen recently?
Oh man... probably Mutoid Man in Atlanta.
You saw Mutoid Man? How were they?
Dude, they're crazy good. Really goofy.
I've watched some of their live clips on YouTube; they seem super fun.
They were awesome. My brother went with me, and he caught one of the drummer's drum sticks. It was a pretty sweet night!
