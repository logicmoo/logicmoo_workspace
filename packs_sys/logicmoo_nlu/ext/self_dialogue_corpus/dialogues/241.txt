The superhero movies out now are so "modern" and angst ridden. What do you think of an older, classic superhero film like the 1977 Superman, and that series?
I really liked Christopher Reeve's Superman. He had a natural nobility about him that was really admirable.
I liked the traditional, old fashioned feel too. The majesty of the opening scenes on Krypton. Using Marlon Brando as Jor-El was reallly cool, added gravity.
The music by John Williams just couldn't be beat, either. It was a wonderful experience watching that one.
I remember the first time Superman lifts off and flies across the screen, it was so perfect. You really thought they figured out a way for him to fly.
Those were the days, when special effects were done with sweat and blood on the set, not just inside a computer.
Watching those older superhero movies, knowing how much work went into making the heroes super, I really get a kick out of those.
Sometimes I watch the modern superhero films, and I feel like I'm watching Super Mario Bros, the way the CGI heroes bounce around and don't look real at all.
That first Hulk movie, the one Ang Lee did. Besides being kind of embarrassing, the Hulk was just awful, he was so plastic.
At least the CGI these days is starting to approach realism, when there's enough money. Obvious CGI, you can have it, I'll go watch Christopher Reeve flly again.
