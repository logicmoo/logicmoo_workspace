Have you ever seen the Pirate Movie?
No, I have not, is it any good.
Yes, it's a Pop Culture filled slapstick and rocked up version of the musical play The Pirates of Penzance.
I've heard of that play, but how does the movie differ?
Well, it is set in then modern times, the mid80s and is about an American excahnge student named Mabel Stanley at a Pirate festival in Austrialia
Okay, what happens
Mabel meets a guy and when she tries to join him on his boat, her exchange family sisters dupe her and take off without her.
Okay, so they leave at the pier. SO then, what happens.
She tries to follow in a rented boat, but gets swamped and knocked out. She washes ashore on an island and has a comedic pirate themed dream.
Okay, sound a bit different, but I might look to see if I can find and watch it.
