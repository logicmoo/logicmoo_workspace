Have you watched the new CHIPS movie?
The one with Dax Shepard and Michael Pena?
That's the one. I just watched it today and feel lukewarm about it.
Is it considered an action or a comedy?
I would say it's an action comedy in the buddy cop mold. It tried to be really funny and witty with its jokes, physical humor, and situation comedy but I felt it was really flat and oddly paced.
Is Kristen Bell in this movie? She's always in movies with her husband Dax.
Yes Kristen Bell is in here, small role for her, and she's really unlikable. I think the movie did a good job with the action and some of the chemistry element between Michael Pena and Dax but overall there seems to be so much out of place and forced.
That's a shame to hear. I remember watching the trailers, and hearing the original TV Show theme song and thinking wow this is going to be a nostalgia blast.
I think they did a good job for some of the homage to the TV series, as there is a cameo from Erik Estrada, the original Ponch.
Well at least it has the original Ponch going for it. I'm sure if you were a fan of the original TV show you might get a kick out of this new movie even though as you described it, as not being perfect.
