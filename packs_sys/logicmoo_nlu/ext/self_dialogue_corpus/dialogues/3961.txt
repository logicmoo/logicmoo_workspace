You ever feel like you wanted to talk to someone about certain movies because you like conversing about how good they where.
Yes i know the feeling it feels good right and makes you think alot what movie do you want to chat with me about?
I would like to talk about this Thriller movie called Piranha it was also a scary movie.
Oh yeah i saw that it was about killer fish starring Julie Forester and Elisabeth Shue right.
Yes they were on this island called lake Victoria and all the children were there and they were all enjoying the summer at the lake.
And they decided to have parties on the lake and peoples bodies were ending up getting eaten inside the lake.
So the sheriff of the town had to get together with the beach attendants and find a way to destroy them.
Yes they told everyone to stay out of the water and began coming up with plans to destroy the Piranha fish.
So they had to figure out how to rid them so that the lake would become safe enough again to go back into the water. At the end they lead the head leader Piranha to the boats.
And they tricked them into thinking they were going to have some more dinner by eating people and the sheriff and the captain teamed up and blew them away. .
