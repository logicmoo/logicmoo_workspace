Have you watched any good horror movies of late?
Well, I did recently catch this movie called Split, but I'm not sure if you'd categorize it as horror.
Oh, I caught that, the M. Night Shyamalan movie with James McAvoy.
Yeah that one, I thought it was really good!
What was your favorite thing about that movie?
I enjoyed the mystery it presented, with all the personalities that James was cycling through, you never knew what to expect next.
I thought he did an amazing job, and the movie definitely kept me in suspense. I didn't know what was going to happen to the captives.
I was expecting a typical cliche horror movie, but it turned out to be so much more.
I kept waiting for the twist to happen like in all M. Night movies, but I don't think there really was one other than maybe the beast reveal?
That wasn't really a twist in the movie, I don't think, it was presented to us throughout, the fact of it being present was there, but we just didn't know if it was going to be true or not.
You're right, I did expect the 'beast' to be real, since it is an M. Night movie, but I really liked the way they kept us guessing up to the end.
I didn't think it was going to be real, I thought for sure, it was going to be just another personality and not a full on, supernatural thing.
Did knowing that throw you off about the movie?
Oh it definitely throw me off about the movie, I think I enjoyed it more, then when they showed Bruce in the closing scene, I was mind blown!
That was really something else! I loved the fact that this movie ties in with his previous one! Didn't see that coming!
M. Night is essentially creating his own Superhero Universe if you think about it!
That's true, now I'm hoping there's a follow up to this so that it'll somewhat complete his trilogy!
I read somewhere that this movie is definitely a follow up and there is going to be another one just as you wanted!
That's fantastic! If it's anything like Split, I think I'm there opening night!
Count me in, I'm sold!
