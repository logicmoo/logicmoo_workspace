How do you feel about the NFL's rules?
I think they've gotten too restrictive over the past few years and I'm glad they're relaxing their stance a bit
True, the excessive celebration penalty is itself pretty excessive
I like seeing players celebrate, but I understand the reason for it
I don't like watching players on teams I don't like celebrate, like Antonio Brown on the Steelers
Sure but that doesn't mean that players shouldn't be able to celebrate more in general
I do think the celebrations have to be classy, and they can still be flashy
I wish they'd relax more on the goal post celebrations that Jimmy Graham popularized
They cracked down on that because he kept hitting the posts and making them have to readjust them
That one makes more sense, whereas other celebrations that don't disrupt the game should be left intact
Some players got away with a lot, like Marshawn Lynch grabbing his crotch as he jumped into the end zone
It may have been in bad taste, but I don't think most people would object to it on the grounds that it was entertaining
That's a good point, since the NFL is a source of entertainment, and it should be entertaining
Absolutely, and that's why those rules were getting out of hand
Some players have come up with iconic celebrations, like Victor Cruz doing a salsa dance in the end zone
Man I miss Victor Cruz dancing in the end zone
Me too, and I hope he does really well on the Bears, even though I'm not a huge Bears fan
It's fine to be a fan of a player even if you aren't a fan of the team they're on
Case in point, Jimmy Graham, who went from the Saints--one of my favorites--to the Seahawks, my least favorite team!
Maybe they just have better goal posts in Seattle that are harder to knock out of alignment
