I just saw Deadpool and really loved it.
I did not get to see it yet but I have heard great things about it.
There is tons of action and Marvel Comics movies are always the way to go.
Ryan Reynolds is a wonderful actor I heard he did a great job.
Oh my, he really did! You get to fall in love with the soft side of Deadpool.
I heard that Wade gets cancer in the movie, is that true.
It is true! I don't want to spoil too much but he has a soft side and it's really sweet that he leaves for Vanessa's sake.
Does Wade and Vanessa get married at the end?
Well, she is really upset that he left her, but she's happy to have him back at the end.
I really need to watch this movie, I think I am going to rent it tonight and indulge myself.
