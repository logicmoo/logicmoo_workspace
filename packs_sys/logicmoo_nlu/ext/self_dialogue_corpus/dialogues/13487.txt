What was that Star Wars movie called with the Ewoks in it? It was an off-shoot of the Empires Strike Back I think.
That's an old one. It was called Ewoks, the Battle for Endor. Is that even part of the Star Wars Franchise?
I'm not sure, I know that Wicket, the first Ewok that befriended Princess Leia, was portrayed in it. But, I watched it for the first time a few days back and it seemed interesting.
It is, it does have some action in it, limited only to the planet Endor. No space battles or Jedi with their light sabers fighting one another. Kind of reminded me of a kids movie, like Dark Crystal or  Labyrinth.
I can attest to that. It was interesting though to see the Ewok world portrayed and described in much deeper detail. We should watch it again together this weekend?
No, even though I am not impartial to that movie, I would still prefer not to watch it again. When it comes to Star Wars, I want to watch unlimited action and adventure.
So then what do you want to watch this weekend?
I say we rent the Star Wars New Hope Trilogy and splurge on those movies. Make it a whole day too, because I can never get enough of looking at Luke Skywalker.  What do you think about that?
I'm well ahead of you. I already have everything set up for the weekend. Star Wars movies and all. Can't wait to kick back in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon for the whole day! You  bring the popcorn?
Popcorn. Check. Movies. Check. A date with Star Wars, here we come!
