I just the trailer for Jackie Chan's new movie, The Foreigner.
Oh yeah?  What is it about?
It actually reminds me a lot of that Liam Neeson movie, Taken, except in this one Jackie's daughter is killed in a terrorist attack and he is after revenge.
So what makes it like Taken then?
Oh, Jackie is apparently some kind of special forces retired guy, so it makes me think of that "I have a particular set of skills" bit, you know?
Okay, I get it So does it look good?
Yeah.  I mean, it's Jackie Chan. He's getting older, so he's slowing down some though.
I kind of noticed that in Kung Fu Yoga.  I mean, he still fights and stuff but he does a lot of things almost standing in one place, blocking.
A lot less running around and climbing up walls and stuff.
Exactly.
You know he always does all his own stunts so it's to be expected.  I mean, how old is he now?
He's 63.
That's pretty impressive then, that he's still basically an action hero!
No kidding.  Remember when Van Damm started getting old?
Actually, he's only 56.
Seriously?  Because it seemed like in his last few movies, like Pound of Flesh, he looked to me like he was really stiff.
He had a big cocaine habit for a while you know. And then he's also bipolar, too.
Wow, no I didn't know anything about that.
He's supposed to have a new movie out in 2018, Black Water, where he is co-staring with Dolph Lundgren.
That should be a good one.
