what do you think is the most romantic beatles song?
I would pick something, by George Harrison.
That is a romantic one. Imagine if it was written about you..
ya then it turns into the ultimate love song.
I think all their wives at that time were featured in the music video.
I believe that is right. I slightly recall yoko in shorts and in a park with john.
Something like that. Smart move on their part, Happy wife Happy Life.
I don't think john lennon would agree. it seemed like the happier he and yoko were the less happy the band life got.
I wonder if yoko really was a major reason they split or if it was bound to happen no matter what.
Who can say. I am just glad we had them for as long as we did. The music is great!
