Who was your favorite character from Rogue One?
I liked the K-2SO a lot. He was pretty funny.
Yes that movie had a very serious tone so it was good to have a comic relief character in the story.
Definitely. Some people say that his jokes seemed a little forced and shoehorned in but I disagree.
Is he your favorite droid overall from the Star Wars movies?
It's hard to say he's better than the awesome droids like C3PO or R2D2 of course. I wouldn't go so far as to say he was better but he was a good character.
Who did the voice for K-2O? Do you know?
Alan Tudyk actually did the voice for him. They also used motion capture so the actor actually acted out the role and not only used his voice.
That's impressive! I had no idea, I thought it was CGI or  a puppet or something.
Well it was CGI but they used the actual actor as a reference for the CGI so it looks very natural.
