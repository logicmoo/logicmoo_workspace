how many groups or soloists have you seen live in concert?
Only one; i saw Simon and Garfunkel in central park, new york once.  how about you?
well, my wife and I take our daughter to a concert every year as a treat.  we let her pick who she wants to see.
Oh man that's cool! who have you seen?
the one that comes to mind first, is the first concert we took our daughter to.  it was approximately in 1997.
wow that's a long time ago.  who was the performer?
believe it or not, my daughter, who was real young then, wanted to see the Spice Girls.
the Spice GIrls! how cute! how was the show?
the show itself was good; they were down to four Spice Girls then after one had left the band.
tell me more about the experience.
well, for one thing, i had to drive quite far to get there, and the weather was lousy that night.  it was pouring rain.
Did the rain interfere with the concert?
No, the place was covered.  but we had to wait on line outside and let me tell you, we got drenched.  then after the show, we must have waited at least an hour to get out of the parking lot; what a mess.
did any other group appear with the Spice Girls that night?
Now that you mention it, no other group performed.  the Spice Girls were on their own and they did real well, let me tell you.
does your daughter have a favorite spice girl?
well, it's been a long time since we talked about them; i really don't remember.  for some reason i liked "Sporty Spice," i don't know why.
LOL.  i was reading an article about concerts just the other day; i couldn't believe the ticket prices at some of these events.
tell me about it.  you have to be reach to get good seats at some of these events.
I know it.  well give my regards to your daughter and tell her to listen to an old spice girl CD just for the memory.
