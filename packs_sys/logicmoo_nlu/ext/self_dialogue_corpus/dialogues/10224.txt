What do you think is the ultimate action film?
I would go with Die hard.
That is a great action film. So Iconic.
Yes and one of the only action movies I also consider a christmas movie.
Ha that is true. Nothing says christmas like die hard.
Well it does take place at a christmas office party. I think alan rickman would agree.
Hans gruber what a great character. Rickman did that role so well.
I think of them as two in one almost. Though rickman was a superb actor in other roles, hans was my favorite performance of his.
I enjoy rickman in all his roles from hans to snape to love actually. But Hans is such an iconic bad guy and probably my favorite role for him.
Ya I did not care to see hans /rickman in the love actually role at all.
