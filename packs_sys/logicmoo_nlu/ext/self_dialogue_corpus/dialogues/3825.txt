Want to watch this great Thriller movie with me from 1992 called the Crying Game it's a weird movie i think i seen it already but it was so good.
Yeah i don't have anything else to do why not I love interesting movies the name does sound kind of cool and crazy.
Yeah crazy it was the kind of movie that made me feel kind of freaked out until i understood what was going on.
You mean to tell me it was that weird and off the hook what made it weird? I guess i will see.
Well there's this Irish Republican Army member Stephen Rea i believe he plays as the man who gets involved in a affair thinking it is a man when it turns out to be a woman.
How does this take place? I cannot understand how two men ended up together.
An unexpected bond with Jody Forest Whitaker a kid napped British Soldier Jody makes Fergus promise he'll visit his girlfriend and when Fergus flees to the city he seeks her out.
wow what a movie but how did the man end up seeing another man romantic wise. I guess i will have to keep watching.
Well during the movie he meets the woman inside a bar but don't know it's a man he continues seeing the man and one day the man decides to tell his lover the truth.So the lover finds out he is devastated and everything crazy people start to fight and murder each other it gets unimaginable and ugly. The lover takes the blame and goes to jail for a long time.
It was a really crazy movie it was very awful and confusing to me but anyway thanks for taking the time out to explain to me about the crazy movie thriller we just watched.
