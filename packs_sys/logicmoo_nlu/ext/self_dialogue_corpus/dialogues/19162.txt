Why were you and the kids laughing so much in the car?
Because we were singing silly songs!
Something I know?
Are you familiar with Trout Fishing in America?
The Richard Brautigan novel?
No, this is a kids music duo.
Do they write their own songs?
Yes.  They are a riot!
Why?
Here is an example; The Window, a nursery rhyme song where "throw it out the window" replaces the lyrics at a certain point.
What???
"Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater had a wife and couldn't feed her; put her in a pumpkin shell and THREW HER OUT THE WINDOW!!!
Do another!
"Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet, eating her curds and whey; along came a spider and sat down beside her.....SHE THREW IT OUT THE WINDOW!!!"
That's a riot!
"Old Mother Hubbard went to her cupboard to get her poor doggie a bone.  But when she bent over the doggie took over and THREW HER OUT THE WINDOW!!!"
The kids really seem to get a kick out of it.
They sing all of the choruses, and ick their feet.  It's so cute!
I'm going to have to get one of their CDs.
They do concerts for kids and adults too.  I don't know if they have adult CDs as well.
