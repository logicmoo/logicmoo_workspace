Do you like the Beatles?
I love them! I used to listen to them when I was young; my uncle gave me a bunch of their albums.
What's your favorite?
Probably the White Album. I know that's an unusual choice, probably. It's so weird and experimental.
Not me, I found that too weird for my taste. I like their earliest stuff. So sweet, melodic and romantic.
I dig it. But for me when they started to get more...I don't know, spiritual and psychedelic, that's when they got really interesting.
Hmm. I do tend to like a band's "experimental stage." Like, if they are talented enough, eventually they start to really push the envelope in their own way.
True. For the Beatles I think it was maybe Revolver that was the turning point there, or maybe Sgt. Peppers'.
I did really love Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, one of the greatest albums of all time.
They were a true gift to music, for sure.
