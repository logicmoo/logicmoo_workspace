You know what's strange? Spy Kids and Machete take place in the same universe.
No, really, Danny Trejo plays the same character in each of the Spy Kids movies.
That's weird. I wonder what other movies have subtle shared universes.
I think the Quentin Tarantino movies take place in the same universe.
Oh, some people say the Pixar movies take place in the same universe.
That one probably isn't true. The Marvel films all share a universe, though.
That's obvious. Though, also made by Disney.
Some people think that Tangled and Frozen exist in the same universe. That's Disney too.
Heck, if you want to take it further, some people think all Disney films exist in the same universe.
Man, I miss the days when movies were just one and done.
What do you mean? No sequels?
No sequels, no interlocking, connected universe. Just one movie, beginning, middle, end, over.
We still get movies like that. They're just not big blockerbuster hits.
I guess you're right. Even on the rare occasion I want a sequel to a movie like that, I never get one.
Like what?
District 9. Great movie that felt fine on its own, but I would love a sequel.
It could still happen. I mean, even Unbreakable is getting a sequel all this time later.
Two, technically, if you count Split.
Talk about secret shared universes, there you go!
Whoa, you're right. That's a franchise that started out as a single story, unconnected into everything, then blossomed into a shared universe.
