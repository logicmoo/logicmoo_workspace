What's your favorite scene out of any Star Wars movie?
It would have to be the fight between Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker at the end of Revenge of the Sith.
Mine I would have to say is where Luke Skywalker finds out Darth Vader is his father.
That's classic. The shock everyone must have felt who watched it when it first came out.
Oh yeah that's one of the best twists in history.
I agree. It was pretty awkward that Luke and Princess Leia kissed before they found out they were brother and sister.
Yeah that was a pretty rough pill for them to swallow I would imagine.
Han Solo is my favorite character. He cracks me up.
Yes I love Harrison Ford in everything he does, but that's my favorite role of his.
Also Chewy is so lovable, and I love how close his and Han Solo's relationship is.
