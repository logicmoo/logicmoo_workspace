What did you think of the remake of the movie "Point Break"?
I wasn't happy at first, just because I think Hollywood needs to chill out with remaking great old movies, but after watching the remake I thought it was pretty good.
I couldn't agree more. I can't picture Point Break without Keanu Reeves acting at Johnny Utah but the remake followed the orginal storyline pretty well.
The remake had just as much or even more action scenes then the orginial one that was released in 1991.
Can't believe the first one was released in 1991! It's still a classic movie and one of my favorites.
Kathryn Bigelow did a fanstatic job directing the orginial Point Break, as an audience member, the film really throws you into Johnny Utah's extreme life.
Speaking of extreme, how bout that skydiving scene in the first movie? I love that scene.
When Johnny Utah jumps out the airplane with no parachute to catch Bodhi? Yeah man, I doubt that would be possible in real life but it sure looked good on the big screen.
Sometimes I wish I lived a life like Johnny Utah.
I dressed up as one of the dead presidents for halloween a few years ago.
