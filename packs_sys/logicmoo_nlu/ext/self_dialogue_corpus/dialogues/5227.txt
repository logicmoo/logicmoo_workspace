Did you see the new Beauty and the Beast movie?
Yes I did. Have you seen it.
No not yet, I don't think it will be as good as the original.
I thought it was so nice to see Belle's beautiful dress, and see the Mrs. Pots, Chip, Lumier and Cogsworth come to life.
I just didn't like how they made Cogsworth, Lumier and the maid feather duster look. I don't think they look as good as the original. Also, the CGI effects for the beast are very unrealistic.
I really liked how everyone came to life, and they even made the songs like "Be Our Guest" look excellent!
I am also not very happy about the added story line at the beginning of the movie. I don't think they needed to add a scene about her mothers death in a children's movie. It wasn't in the original and it doesn't make the movie better at all.
I think it is good to see the back story behind Belle and her father, but it is a little much for a children's movie.
Maybe I will see it I really like the sound track of the movie. Belle, the beast and Gaston did such a good job singing and the song "tale as old as time" when Belle and the beast are dancing sounds so romantic!
I agree the soundtrack is beautiful, I think you should see it so you can compare every part of it to the origional!
