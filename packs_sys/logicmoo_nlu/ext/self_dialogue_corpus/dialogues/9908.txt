Which rap artist would you like to see collaborate with Bruno Mars?
I hope to see Mase on a track with him someday.  Don't you think?
That would be cool.  I remember he use to work with artists like Brandy and Mariah Carey.   Did he mostly collaborate with women?
Yeah, he usually rapped on women's records.  But he had some great songs with Puff Daddy.  Do you remember those from the 90's?
Heck yeah!  My favorite was 'Mo Money Mo Problems.'  What about you?
Great choice.  I'd have to go with the 'Only You' remix.
Oh, how I miss the Shiny Suit days!
Seriously.  Some of the outfits they wore in those music videos were pretty sweet!
Yeah it's too bad artists don't make many music videos anymore.  When's the last time you've seen a rap music video on television?
Does youtube.com count?
