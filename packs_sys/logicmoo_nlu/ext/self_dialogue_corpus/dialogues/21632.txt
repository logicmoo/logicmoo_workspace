What is your favorite best picture winner?
I think that should be obvious:  Rocky.
What is your least favorite best picture winner?
It's a toss up between Chicago and Lord of the Rings, Return of the King.
Why?
Well, Chicago wasn't very good, didn't even think it should've been nominated, much less win.
What about Return of the King?
I didn't really care for the Lord of the Rings movies, they were too long, and bored me.
But you can appreciate the work, and detail that was put into the movie, right?
Yeah, I can.  Honestly, I just really wanted Lost in Translation to win.  I thought it was much more engaging.
Ah yes, ol Scar Jo, right when she started to break out.
Yeah, I've loved her since Ghost World.  That's an underrated movie.
I remember when I was a kid, and watched Heavy Metal, and there were trailers before the movie.
What were the trailers?
Last Supper, City of Lost Children, and Crumb.
That's certainly an eclectic mix.
Yeah, I guess they considered anyone who bought Heavy Metal on VHS an eclectic bunch.  Anyway, I remember I made it a point to seek out and watch all three of those movies.
Were they any good?
Yeah, at the very least, interested.  Crumb is a documentary, and it's really out there.
I remember Last Supper-- it's got quite the star studded cast.
