How do you like Fast Furious?
I think it's a great movie series, if Harry Potter accompanied my childhood, I think Fast and Furious accompanied my teenagehood.
I kinda feel the same, well you kinda make us look old, haha
did I? that wasn't intentional, but which one was your favorite?
you remember the one where the crew dragged a safe across the street of Rio?
oh yeah, it was such a blast in that summer, I can still remember it vividly
It's crazy what they can do with cars, do you remember which car they used to drag the safe?
that I'm not sure, it seemed to be a bullet proof super tough military SUV
indeed, I don't see myself buying one in the near future
me neither
