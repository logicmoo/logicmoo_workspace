Do you know how Star Wars changed the toy industry?
They increased the sales of figure toys?
Not exactly. They promoted the idea of a female character action figure, which had always been lacking before.
Do you mean Princess Leia?
No, Rey from The Force Awakens. Before her, there were rarely female action figures, because they just didn't sell well.
And Rey was so popular it changed the demand?
Yes. People had complained before about not being able to find female character figures, and even leading up to the movie there was no Rey. But after the movie came out, she was on everything, and outsold everyone except the villian character.
I bet the times had a lot to do with the change. Girls and women are no longer shy about standing up and complaining through social media about unfair treatment.
Now thanks to Rey, toy stores have all kinds of female action figures, like Wonder Woman and Batgirl.
Kids have started to break molds now too about what they should be interested in playing with.
