Have you ever regretted taking your kid to see a Disney movie?
No, why? Have you?
Yes, my son is 8 now, but he is still scared from a movie he saw at a noon showing a couple years ago- Finding Nemo.
Oh, all the big fish trying to eat everyone?
Yes. My husband was talking about a friend's aquarium he admired, and said he'd really like to get one for the living room, and my son threw a fit.
Oh my. Maybe he would learn it's not so scary if you just got a few nice fish?
Well, fish do eat each other sometimes, and they die really easily, so I told my husband it would be too traumatic.
Is your son still really sensitive about that?
We had to leave during the movie because he started crying when Marlin's wife and their eggs were eaten, and then with the big fish with all the teeth, he kept crying and saying he didn't like it, so we left.
No, I guess an aquarium would not be a good idea.
