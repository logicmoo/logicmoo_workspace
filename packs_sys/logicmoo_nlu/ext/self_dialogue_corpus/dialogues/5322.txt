Hey, do you like the Disney movie Tangled?
Are you kidding? It's my favorite movie! I love Rapunzel!
I do too! I love Flynn Ryder too. His story is so great. I'm glad he ends up happy and not a thief anymore.
Yeah. I think Rapunzel and Flynn go together well. He really helps her learn about who she is.
It's sweet how he takes her to see the floating lanterns, isn't it?
Yes. That's my favorite part. It's so romantic and the song they sing is such a great song.
I think the song in the Ugly Duckling with all the scary guys is my favorite. The one called I've Got A Dream.
Haha, yeah. It's funny to hear about all the characters dreams. They really put a lot of thought into that song.
I bet it was a fun movie to make. The animation was really great, too.
Yeah I love everything about the movie. The songs are so catchy and the story is so heart-warming.
