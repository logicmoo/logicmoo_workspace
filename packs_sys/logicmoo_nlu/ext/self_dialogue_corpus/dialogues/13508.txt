Who in the Star Wars (Expanded Universe) series, was your favorite villain?
I have many favorite villains I look up to, but if I have to choose one— than I must say it's got to be Supreme Leader Snoke.
Snoke is hard to beat I admit, but I believe Darth Vader tops him by a mile. How about your favorite hero or heroine in the Star Wars EU franchise?
That's a tough call, but I have a soft spot for Jin Erso in Rogue One. She was a real heroine who gave her life for the greater cause. How about you?
That first name that pops into my mind is Yoda, of course. He has been through it all within the Star Wars Franchise. I secretly hope to see him as a Force Ghost in the upcoming movies.
Did you know that Ren in the Force Awakens heard Yoda's voice speaking to her in her Force Dream? Do you think that has any significance in the next movie?
I hope so, as a Force Awakens fan, it would be something I'd love to see in the movie. Most of all I want to see how Kylo Ren and Rey are related. IF they truly are.
I think they are, they have to be. Cousins at least. Can you imagine the battle between them if Ren were a Skywalker and Kylo as a Solo? Who would win?
Kylo has Snokes power behind him, then again, Rens potential has not been challenged yet. Only have to wait and see what Luke's training will afford her. I also hope to see Finn make a grand return in The Last Jedi.
He will, though I don't know in what way they will portray him after receiving such a grave injury by Kylo near the end of Force Awakens. We just have to wait and see.
