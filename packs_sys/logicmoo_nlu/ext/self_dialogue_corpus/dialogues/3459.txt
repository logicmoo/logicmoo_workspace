My friend I saw this horror movie called The house of wax and it was a great exciting horror flick too.
Oh yeah when did you see the movie and what was the movie about? Was it really scary?
Well yes of course you know i only go check out the scariest ones. It was staring Jared P. Elisha C.and a few other famous actors I like.
In the beginning of the movie a car load of friends get a flat tire and they end up in a ghost town they are forced to stop at a wax museum and this turns out to be almost as worse as A night mare on Elm street.
Cool I like horror movies tell me more about the movie this one sounds really good.
It was great so okay they begin making tents to spend the night and slowly one by one was going inside the house of wax seeing weird things and disappearing.
Wow why were they disappearing? and who was causing them to disappear and how were they missing I ?think I know but go on continue.
Well they were getting murdered one by one and i was so upset to see the actress Paris H.go when one of them caught and slashed her. each body they would hide and then turn them into wax.
I have got to check this out this horror movie so don't tell me to much about the ending I want to see it for my self.
Okay but i want to give you a small hint that is shocking the twins at the end turn out to be triplets. I hope you will enjoy the movie because I sure did.
