We spoke about Nightmare on Elm Street losing it's luster after Freddy became too much of a comedian, but Wes Craven's return to direct New Nightmare was pretty good!
I think the fact that Wes Craven came back to direct really stood out in that movie. I loved the meta theme of that movie.
It was brilliant! He structured the movie to appear as if we've been watching actors in the movie playing actors in a Nightmare on Elm Street movie!
I love Heather Langenkamp, and I'm glad Wes brought her back to play Nancy once again, although this time she played herself as Heather, being the actress Nancy!
The concept of the movie had me sold from the start and when I heard Heather was back I knew I had to check this out back then.
I think Heather was last scene in Dream Warriors, the Third Nightmare on Elm Street, which was probably the last one of that was decent and a lot of fans really have that as their favorite.
I enjoyed Dream Warriors a lot. It was fun, it was scary, we got a horrifying Freddy, but there were shades of Freddy getting too corny with his lines.
Let's not even talk about the next few, but back to New Nightmare, the way the put Freddy in there was so well done. I didn't expect the puppetry to come to life but Wes is a genius. He made this work.
New Nightmare to me, is a classic, but I think fans that enjoyed the comical wise cracking one liner Freddy, didn't enjoy it as much. The true fans will hold New Nightmare in high regard though.
It's probably my second favorite to the first Nightmare on Elm Street with a young Johnny Depp, don't forget about that!
