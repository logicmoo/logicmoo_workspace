Who do you think will make the Super Bowl this year?
I don't know man, its way too early.
Okay, but just for fun. Take a stab at it.
Hmm. I'll say Packers and Patriots.
Ahh come on. That's boring. That's basically like picking all the #1 seeds in an NCAA bracket.
Well, they both re-loaded in the offseason.
Okay, but if you had to pick two sleeper picks for the Super Bowl, what would you say?
Hmmm. I'll say the Chargers and the Buccaneers
Whoa, I've heard a lot of hype about Tampa Bay, but not really for San Diego.
Yeah, I just think they have a lot of good pieces on offense and the AFC is pretty open after the Patriots.
I don't know much about their defense.
Neither do I, but look at Rivers, Gordon, Gates, and Keenan Allen.
Oh wow I forgot about Keenan Allen after his injury last year.
Yeah he's a monster when healthy.
Yeah last year I predicted him to be a top 5 fantasy WR, and took him in the 2nd round.
Ouch that hurts.
Well, I'm sure the injury hurt worse for him, but yeah.
You know what else has got to hurt? The Chargers are leaving San Diego after the year.
Yeah that's a complete shame. The Chargers belong in San Diego.
Yup, but a team in Vegas will be fun.
