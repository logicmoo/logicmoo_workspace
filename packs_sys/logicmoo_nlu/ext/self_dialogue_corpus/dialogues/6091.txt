What is your favorite, newer, Disney movie?
The Princess and the Frog.
I love Tiana's dress when she gets married in the swamp!
I do too. I also love the one where she is in the club that the Shadowman shows her.
It really is a great movie. The ode to the food and Mardi Gras. Especially the gumbo.
That scene where her father comes home, tired and exhausted is one of my favorites. Especially when they invite everyone to join them for gumbo.
That right there is true family values, and shows that no matter how much money you have, family is everything.
That love story of Evangeline and Ray is a tear jerker. Gets me everytime.
Me too. I would watch a Disney short on that.
I would too. And one on Mama Odie.
