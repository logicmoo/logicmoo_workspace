Hey what's your favorite comedy movie?
Wow that's a tough one. I guess I'd have to say The Hangover series.
That's a good choice, I like those too. Zach Galifianakis is a very funny man.
I think my favorite part is in The Hangover 3 when he has the romance with Melissa Mcarthy. That was just too hilarious.
Why haven't they made a movie together yet? They really need to!
Did you ever see that one called Identity Thief? Where she was with Jason Bateman?
Oh yeah it was kind of like a road trip movie. It wasn't too bad!
And then Zach had the one where he was with Robert Downey Junior. What was that called again?
I believe it was called Due Date. It had some funny scenes, but also some really gross ones.
That's right I totally forgot about that. Gross humor in movies is good sometimes, but then other times they take it a bit too far.
Who was your favorite character in The Hangover movies? Was it Zach?
Actually as funny as he was I kind of the guy Chow. I think he really stole the show in his scenes.
Oh yeah he is really funny! When he jumps out of the trunk naked was my favorite part.
I honestly think those movies don't go downhill like a lot of sequels do. They stay funny to me.
Did you ever see the movie The 40 Year old Virgin?
Yeah I think I did a long time ago. I remember thinking it was really funny.
I watched it recently and remembered how awesome it was. Man Seth Rogan was really hilarious.
I really like him in a lot of movies. I thought he was especially funny in Pineapple Express.
Yeah stoner comedy seems to be his niche, although I like seeing him do some directing and writing as well. He's a really smart guy.
Him and James Franco really are the Cheech and Chong of our generation. I think their stuff will remain timeless.
