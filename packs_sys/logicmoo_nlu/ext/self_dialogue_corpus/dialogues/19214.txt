Whatever happened to harmony in popular music?
You mean like doo-wop, or the Four Seasons: that kind of thing? I guess it kind of went out of fashion after the Fifties.
Not necessarily -- think of Peter, Paul and Mary, or Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, in the Sixties.  It became more complex later.
It's still around -- think of NSYNC or One Direction; or what about Destiny's Child, with Beyonce?
i don't know -- it seems like they're just used as launching pads for singers now. Like NSYNC and Justin Timberlake.
Or One Direction and Harry Styles: I know what you mean. Those groups are just kind of constructed by record companies now.
I just I'm just nostalgic or something.  I was watching Music Man the other day -- remember that song Lida Rose?
Yeah, or Goodnight Ladies.  Wonderful examples of barbershop harmony!
And you can still find it in gospel music: think of the Dixie Hummingbirds or Mighty Clouds Of Joy.
But I see your point -- you don't hear it so much any more in popular music. It's all just a single singer, now: free-styling over a beat.
Actually, there's a form of it that's still in hip-hop: think of the way someone like NWA or the Beastie Boys would take turns rhyming.
Isn't that more call-and-response?
Well, it's true that they're not *singing* together: but there's some coordination between the lead vocalists.
You should check out Bone Thugs-N-Harmony then -- they cover the whole spectrum: rapping *and* harmonizing. It's pretty cool!
Oh?  I'm not familiar with them.
Check them out on YouTube: look for their songs Crossroads or I Tried. Harmony is still out there: you might have to dig, but it exists.
Good to know it's out there!
Also check out that girl group Fifth Harmony -- more hip hop, but they have some harmonies!  Look for Boss and Me and My Girls.
Maybe it will become the 'new' way of singing and make a comeback.  I just like the way it sounds.
Isn't that how it always is: everything old becomes new again eventually!
