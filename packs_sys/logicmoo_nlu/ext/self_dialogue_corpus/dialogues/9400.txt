What's your favorite rap song of all time?
That's a tough question because they have different feelings, so they aren't all comparable. I'll go with "Hypnotize" by the Notorious BIG.
Great song, a classic of the bragging style of rap. Sometimes you want more meaningful rhymes, sometimes just a great beat and fun lyrics.
Agreed. His "Juicy" song is definitely a more thoughtful song.
That's another classic. I was just listening to "Broken Wings" by Tupac the other day. The lyrics are like poetry.
You don't hear that much anymore in today's rap.
At least not on the radio, but if you look a little deeper you can find some really smart rappers.
Any recommendations?
Off the top of my head, Zion I is a good one, Kendrick Lamar is kind of straddling both worlds.
Yeah, good point. He's as much an artist as a rapper.
