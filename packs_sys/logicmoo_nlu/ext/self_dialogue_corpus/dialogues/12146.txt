I was three years old when Star Wars: A New Hope was released in 1977.
Did you get to see it in the theater?
No, but I got to see on good old VHS later. I had a huge crush on Mark Hamill!
I  can understand that. I saw the older trilogy later after the Phantom Menace was released. But Mark Hamill was handsome as Luke in A New Hope.
Who was your favorite actor from Phantom Menace?
Definitely Liam Neeson. He was so subtle and had a great acting style. He played Qui-Gon Jinn perfectly.
I read that George Lucas filmed the Star Wars movies in the order that he did, because of the lack of CGI technology in the late 1970's and 1980's.
I believe that's true. There is certainly more room to work in now regarding Sci-Fi movies.
Do you think that the current technology takes away from the human element in the Star Wars saga now?
Not at all. I think the actors shine ever more greatly and that is evident particularly in Rogue One when Cassius and Jyn embrace and die together, for the cause.
