What do you think is the best movie in the Harry Potter series?
Good question. Fantastical Beasts and Where to Find Them was pretty good even if it didn't have the original characters in that one.
Yeah, I liked the seeing all the animals. Some didn't look like what I expected but I thought the first movie, Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone was one of the best.
That's because it was the first. Setting you up for series.
Yeah, they did a good job. A lot to condense down from the books.
I think the Order of the Phoenix is one my favorites, book or movie.
I can see that. It's when things start to get interesting. The movie effects really felt magical.
I think that is part of the best thing about this new technology for movies, they can make it look so real.
Yeah if ever there was magic. The movies from this point forward start to get a little dark.
Yeah, but they've been edited so you don't feel like you are missing much if read also.
Agreed. Back to movies what did you think of Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows Part 1 & 2?
It was unexpected to have split and so painful to wait for the second part. I would have rather sat for four hours than waited another year!
Yeah, me too but it was great didn't you think?
I thought it was good. I was glad to it stayed true to the books. The special effects were off the hook!
I thought so too. Flying around on the back of that dragon! I was getting dizzy!
The cinematography was very well done and really aided in giving you the feeling of being part of the story.
I thought final fight scene was great.
Me too. I was not disappointed though I am still out to lunch on the flash forward in the books and the movies.
It will be interesting to see how the new additions fit in. So far they've done a good job.
I'll go see them and it looks like there are plans for lots more to come!
