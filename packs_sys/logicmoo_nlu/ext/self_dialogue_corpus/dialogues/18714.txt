Do you know the song, "Nights in White Satin"?
Yes.
I was listening to it the other night and I got to thinking...I have no idea what that song is about!
Who cares! It's the Moody Blues!
Well, when I listen to it, I seem to slip into some kind of a mystical funk, or a depressed fog of emotions.
OK. Did you skip breakfast?
Come on. man! I"m serious!
OK. Ok.
The lyrics talk of love, letters that were written, but unsent, as well as emotional pain.
I think it's a song of regret. Lost love or something.
That makes sense I guess. The guy must have taken the girl for granted because he sings about about how how he somehow missed beauty with his eyes.
Yeah, and he also says something about not knowing what the truth is anymore. Perhaps, as time has gone on, he is not so certain as to why they broke up in the first place.
Makes sense. And he sings about how people walking hand-in-hand can't understand how he feels, which probably means he feels alone in his sorrow and that those still in relationship can't understand his heart ache.
I think you got a handle on it!
Yeah, but what I can't figure out is what's with the white satin?
He spend nights in white satin.
Does that have some deep meaning about the afterlife, or angels, or some ethereal plane?
I don't know. Maybe his ex girlfriend picked out the satin sheets, and he is till paying them off...
HIgh interest rate credit card!
Yeah. We're good.
