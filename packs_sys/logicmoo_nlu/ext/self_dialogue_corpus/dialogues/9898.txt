Do you know what kind of music I love listening to my friend its called Rap music. I like the kind of rap music from back in the day too.
Yes me too so what's one of your favorite oldies and can you watch them on You Tube?Of course type the name of the Artist in and all kinds of their music will pop up.
Alright i didn't tell you who I liked yet remember Sugar Hill I think they were one of the first Artist that got Hip hop moving and won the first Grammy's.
Yes I remember them they came out with Rapper's delight 8th Wonder Apache and all of the rest of the first rapper's Hit's they were the best to me.
Lets have a little fun rapping The Sugar Hill was my favorite I am going to say a few lines of the rhymes in that record so listen up then it will be your turn.
Okay have you ever went over a friends house to eat and the food just ain't no good I said the macaroni soggy the peas are mushed and the chicken tastes like wood.
Now you what came after that? so you try to play it off while you think you can and you say that you already ate and then your friend says man there's plenty of food so he piled some more on your plate.
My turn and so the chicken still steaming your mind starts to thinking of the moment it's time to leave and the chicken still rotten and something it looks like cheese.
Yeah that was the coolest rapping and rhyming back in the day hip hop songs its so old i got a bit confused with some of the parts but we still had fun didn't we?
Yes we did my friend now i am going on You Tube to look for some more oldies but goodies to talk with you about the next time we get together and chat.
