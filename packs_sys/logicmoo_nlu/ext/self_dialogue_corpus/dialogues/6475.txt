Did you go see the Disney movie Beauty and the Beast that came out in March?
Yes, I love Emma Watson. She is a really great actress, so when I heard she was playing Belle, I had to go see it.
That movie broke all kinds of money records. It had a 160 million budget, and it's expected to make one billion dollars.
Wow, I guess there were a lot of fans like me who had to go see it.
It ranked among the top ten movie openings ever.
I didn't know it was that popular!
It had the biggest opening for a P-G rated movie, and the biggest opening ever in March, which is pretty incredible considering how diverse kid fans are.
I'm sure Emma Watson probably appealed to both girls and boys since she was in the Harry Potter movies.
She was a great pick by the Disney team. I liked her in the film Noah.
I read an article where Emma said playing Belle was a joyous experience.
