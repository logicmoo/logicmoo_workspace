I'm been listening to a lot of Led Zeppelin lately.
I listen to Zeppelin everyday. It blows my mind that some people don't like their music.
Anybody who doesn't like Lez Zeppelin is no friend of mine. Their music has made such an impact on how I view life.
For real. The song Stairway to Heaven has helped me get through some dark times, the song always puts a smile on my face when I hear it.
Such a great song man. I love how long it is and how time basically comes to a stand still while it's playing.
Robert Plant was blessed with a voice from the God's. The different phases of the song is what makes it such a masterpiece
Mhm. Starts off with a slow tempo followed by guitars then concludes with electrics.
Did you see that Rolling Stones top 500 songs of all time magazine? Stairway to Heaven was ranked at 31.
Really? I would have thought Stairway to Heaven would have been ranked in the top ten greatest songs of all time.
I don't agree with the rating either. I think it should have been ranked in the top 5 greatest rock songs.
