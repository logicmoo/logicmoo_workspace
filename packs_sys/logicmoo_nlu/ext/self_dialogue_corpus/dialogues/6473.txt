Did you see that the Moana movie is now on Netflix?
Yes, my daughters watched it the other night.
I'm glad because my daughter requested it for her birthday and now I don't have to buy it.
Those Disney movies are so expensive but I worry that they won't be on Netflix forever. What are you getting her instead?
She also requested Moana's necklace, the one with the heart of Tafiti. It lights up. I grabbed the last one at Wal-Mart.
You know what else you should get her? The Moana soundtrack. The music in that movie is so catchy.
That's a good idea. We're also getting her her first tablet so I could buy the soundtrack online and put it on there for her.
Oh yeah, she'll love it. That song with the hermit crab who likes shiny things was my favorite.
Yeah, I loved that guy too! Make sure to watch after the credits of Moana because he has an extra little scene where he talks about Sebastian from the Little Mermaid.
Oh, I didn't know that! I will have to tell my girls.
