I hated Pulp Fiction.
Why?
Because it kept jumping around from the future to the past, it was confusing.
Yeah, I admit it's edited unusually. But that's part of what makes it great: you see bits that haven't happened yet, and you can't put their significance together until later.
You mean like how these two weirdly dressed guys are eating at a Denny's, and a couple tries to rob the place?
Yeah, exactly. Only later do you know they're hit-men who got bloody and had to changed their clothes.
And what's the deal with the boxer?
He has an agreement to throw a fight so this gangster guy can profit on the bets. But then he changes his mind and has to go on the run.
And then comes the guy with the ball in his mouth.
Yes. This guy is trying to kill him, and they get into the weirdest, freakiest situation and have to help each other.
And then the guy says he won't kill him if they just never tell what happened.
But you already know the hit man went to the boxer's house, and because he was stupid the boxer ends up killing him.
Right. And then you see the hot girl overdose because she snorted something without knowing what it was, and it's this gross overdose scene.
And the hit man is the one who saves her.
Exactly. Even though we know he dies, trying to carry out a hit that got cancelled anyway.
I guess I never put the individual stories together really.
You should watch it again.
I just might do that.
Trust me, you'll like it so much better.
Want to watch it with me?
