What are your top three movies?
Stardust, Warm Bodies, and Scott Pilgrim vs the World. You?
Donnie Darko, I Heart Huckbees, and Southland Tales. What about your favorite trilogy?
Hmm. I would have to go with The Matrix? You?
Classic Star Wars trilogy - Episodes 4-6 all the way.
Not bad. What'd you think of Episode 7.
On one hand I liked how it felt like a modern day retelling of the original saga but on the other I thought there were too many parallels. Did watch it three times so there's that.
Guess you liked it more than you disliked it then.
Yeah... I mean... yeah, you're right. It did a good job at setting up future films though so Episode 8 should be a LOT more enjoyable.
I really liked seeing Luke at the end, but I'm curious what's up with him being all isolated and stuff.
Won't know for sure, but if you remember Yoda and Obi-Wan went into self-exile also.
True. Guess it could be a jedi thing. Have you seen Rogue Squadron yet?
Not yet and have been actively avoiding spoilers since it's came out. Don't ruin it for me!
I won't. I couldn't even if I wanted to as I've prioritized other movies before it. Will get there eventually.
Is it out on bluray yet? I'll probably rent it next weekend since I have off.
Yeah, it's been out since April 4th on dvd and bluray. Only know that because the missus made me preorder and pickup The Bounce Back at the same time.
The Bounce Back? Wasn't that with Shemar Moore, Nadine Velazquez, and Matthew Willig?
Yeah. She loved it, but I thought it was just alright. Not really my cup of tea, but you'd probably like it to be honest.
Thanks, I'll have to borrow it sometime.
Sure thing. Can pick it up when you come over to watch that new Keanu Reeves movie John Wick: Chapter 2 this weekend.
