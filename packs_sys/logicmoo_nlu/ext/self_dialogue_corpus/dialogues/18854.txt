It's funny how you can hear a song for years, and not understand what the words are.
Oh, like on Elton John's "Rocket Man". What's he saying, "Burning up his air out there, alone?"
Something like that. I didn't know myself until I heard the William Shatner version.
Those are fun. Or trying to understand what Elton John's saying on "Yellow Brick Road".
Or "Bennie And The Jets". I still don't know the words.
My brother for years and years thought that Creedence Clearwater Revival was singing about "A Bathroom On The Right".
Oh, on "Bad Moon Rising"? It DOES sound like that.
I still like to think that the lead singer on the "Yes" albums is a female. Because that's what I thought when I was a kid.
It's a shame how some performers are ignored in their own country, like Suzi Quatro.
She's WORSHIPED in Europe, but I know what you mean. Like Jerry Lewis is popular in France.
And David Hasselhoff is a big music star in Austria and Germany.
Suzi Quatro played one mean, big guitar. I remember her "48 Crash" song, years ago. Whatever that was about.
I think there are YouTube videos of that. She was kind of a punk rocker, like the way they tried to do for Joan Jett.
Or Elvis Costello or even Blondie!
I remember when Elvis Costello appeared on "Saturday Night Live" for the first time, around 1975 or 1976.
Well, his "Watching the Detectives" does sound kind of punk.
The funny thing is, we thought his song was a comedy skit, a put on.
Like the Blues Brothers, when they first got on stage.
Right. Or Leon Redbone, who looked like Elliot Gould in disguise as a musician.
Leon Redbone? With the giant tuba and blues songs? Wow, I haven't seen him in years.
