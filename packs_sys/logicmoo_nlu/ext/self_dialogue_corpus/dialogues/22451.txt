Have you seen the remake of Dirty Dancing?
No, and I'm not planning on it, because some movies should never be remade! Patrick Swayze is probably spinning in his grave.
Roadhouse was Patrick Swayze's best movie ever, although Point Break was also really good.
Oh? Who else was in that one?
So it's not only the ever-wonderful Patrick Swayze, but also Keanu Reeves and Gary Busey. Have you seen anything else good lately?
Well, I'm a little embarrassed, but I saw Beauty and the Beast. Emma Watson was great in that, but she'll always be Hermione to me.
Yes, I know what you mean, I loved the Harry Potter movies, I was sad when they were over. There are some good movies coming out soon, too.
Oh, I saw there is going to be a new Minions movie. Did you see the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie?
No, but I love Chris Pratt and I loved the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie. It had an excellent soundtrack too!
Yes, I saved it on Spotify! I actually like the old classic movies too, The Sound of Music was one I watched every year when I was a kid.
Oh, you mean when we didn't have the luxury of having every movie at our fingertips? Yes, I definitely remember that.
There's going to be a new Cars movie this summer too, although I don't think it will come close to the first one.
I agree, I saw the preview and I wasn't impressed. Did you see any of the Oscar-nominated movies this year?
Actually, just this week I saw LaLa Land. I was so uninformed I didn't even realize it was going to be a musical.
Funny! Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were in that one, right?
Yes, I'm a huge fan of Emma Stone's. She has also been in The Help, the Spiderman movies, and more.
What was The Help about?
It was based on a book, in it she is going to be a journalist. It takes place during the Civil Rights era in Missippi.
I'll have to put that one on my list. Was anyone else good in it?
Yes, it also had Viola Davis, and Allison Janney, and I think Jessica Chastain too. You should definitely see it!
