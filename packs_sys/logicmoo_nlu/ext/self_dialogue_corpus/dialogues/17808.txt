Hey, I was going to make a playlist for the party this weekend, what kind of music do you think I should put on it?
Oh awesome, we definitely need something upbeat, like some good pop music.
Okay, I have some Taylor Swift already downloaded.
She's great! I think I liked every song on her album 1989.
Great I'll definitely include that. I also have some Chainsmokerz, if you like them?
Definitely! Can you please add that Paris song too, that one is so catchy.
I will. How do you feel about Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus?
They have some catchy music for sure! I think Miley is going country lately, so if you could add some stuff from her album Bangerz, that's all good party music.
Perfect! I keep hearing Despacito on the radio, so I'll add that one too.
I love that song! It's such a good rhythm I can't help dancing when I hear it.
I agree! That's how I feel about that song Slide by Migos, it's just got such a dance feel.
Oh yeah, we should definitely include some hip-hop! I like 2 chainz and Frank Ocean, Drake, all of those guys.
Yeah! Drake has a new song called Passionfruit that I think you would like, so I'll add that one too.
We should also include some party classics, some older songs that everyone will recognize and like.
Yeah, we could add some AC/DC, or Michael Jackson?
Yes to both. I also think some Prince would be good, and maybe some 80s songs like Tina Turner, Aerosmith, etc.
Perfect, I think this list will have something that everyone will like.
Oh, we should also probably add some birthday related songs since it's the birthday party playlist. What about that Borgore cake song?
Yeah, we could also include Go Shorty, It's Your Birthday. Everyone loves being sung to by 50 Cent
Yes, that's the perfect addition! This is going to be an awesome playlist.
