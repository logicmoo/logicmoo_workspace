I rewatched "The Usual Suspects" the other day and the more I think about this movie, the more ludicrous it seems.
If you're talking about the giant plot hole in the movie as ludicrous, then yes I very much agree.
We have Soze, who pulled all of this off because he wanted to kill/quiet a dude who could identify him and he failed because at the end of the movie a dude did identify him, and the NYPD even had a mugshot of him!
I had this exact question in my head. I'm pretty sure it's just a plot hole. An explanation could be that considering pretty much everything he tells us is a lie, maybe even his motivation for the hit job was a lie?
No that can't be it! Because Mr. Soze never states his mission for the job. It was Detective Kujan who pieced it all together.
Then why did he have to embark on this grand assassination mission in the first place?
The weird part is, they had the seeds for tying this together in Keaton's girlfriend, who is tied to the man that can identify him.
Ah, I forgot about Edie but I'm guessing that maybe Soze just pulled all of this off because he had no other choice.
Maybe Mr. Soze was actually just doing damage control the entire time?
It makes a lot of sense! Here's the breakdown: He was caught by the police, and at the start of the film you can actually hear him genuinely confess. The point is he doesn't actually have some grand plan, his only goal is to tell a story that will get him out the police station so that he can escape.
