What type of music to you like best?
I find myself going for oldies a lot and pop.
That's cool , any recommendations or stand out favorites?
Well I always say the beatles, I thought everyone knew there music but I was the introduction for one guy so now I tell everyone who asks.
I actually love them like the masses, crazy to think some people don't know their music.
I think it is perhaps mostly the younger generation.
Makes sense. What is your favorite beatles song?
I really love across the universe. The lyrics are so poetic and the flow of them creates these images of peace , like a feather floating.
Wow that is a pretty deep response. my favorite is here comes the sun.
That was my cousin wedding isle song, she is blonde and very cheery and fit her so well. It had me tearing up.
I find I get very emotional hearing a lot of the beatles music. Eleanor rigby gets to me, maybe it is the image of a lonely person/people.
They just have countless hits. I adore strawberry fields forever, and hey jude.
Apparently hey jude was written for john lennon's son during his parents divorce.
I think I had heard that . which beatle wrote that one?
It was paul. He and lennon are my favorite.
I think each beatles had his charm but see those two as the most popular.
Ya for sure , I mean look at Imagine..  one of the greatest songs ever and that was Lennon.
Was that from a solo album or still with the beatles?
I am really not sure. It could be from his solo career.I know he alone wrote it.
Either way such an impactful song and he is not doubt a legend among the beatles and world.
