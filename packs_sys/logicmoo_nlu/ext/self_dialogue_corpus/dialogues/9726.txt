So have you ever been into rap or hip hop?
A bit.  I really liked mid-2000s era, with 50 Cent's first album, Ludacris and the Bit Tymers from that era.
Yeah that was a good party era.  How about the hardcore rap of the '90s.
I didn't get too into that, but I remember it.  I specifically remember that was when MC Hammer fell from grace.
Yeah, that was too bad.  He didn't keep up with the times and his "party-pop" style went out of style.
Yeah I watched the VH1 movie about his life and it was interesting.  I remember saying "I'm hyped!" like he said when he was getting ready to record a song.
Yeah I saw that one too.  It was the part when he was on Death Row Records and he was trying to get relevant again.
Haha, those scenes with him and Tupac Shakur were funny!  He said, "Let's get you up and all perky" and Tupac said , "You're gonna get yourself shot!"
Yeah classic.  Fun stuff indeed.
Did you see the movie Straight Outta Compton?
