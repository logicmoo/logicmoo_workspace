What's your favorite Beatles song?
Well, that is a very tough call. There are definitely a few that I would have difficulty choosing from.
I can understand that. Do you have a favorite member?
I'd probably have to say Paul McCartnet. I really also liked his work with Wings.
Oh, for sure. That is also great music.
John Lennon is of course a close second.
Yeah, I would even go so far as to say he is my favorite. Imagine is just one of those songs that I can never turn off.
I hear you on that one.
Sounds like we both are both big fans. Would you be interested in going to see a tribute band concert sometime?
Absolutely. Just let me know when!
