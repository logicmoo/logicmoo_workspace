sup mate,what you up to?
nothing much ,watching mtv
your parents in?
nah, am alone, you coming over to mine?
not immediately,i'm just heeding from work so need to freshen up and all that before i can holla at you.
okay no worries then
oh yeah i had wanted to ask what's the beef between weekend and wizkid all about
oh that, its kinda childish to me on weekends part
why do you say so?
wizkid had been known as starboy for over 5 years before weekend did this new song "starboy" and then starts saying he's the real starboy.
i do not see it that way though,with what i understand about it, it was wizkid who took to twitter and like he's the real starboy on the same day weekend release the single "starboy"
hmm really he did that?
yeah, that was were i think the whole beef might i sprang from
funny though they both do different kind of music,weekend rnb and wizkid afro-pop so don't see why the competition
these days one can't tell, it might just be a marketing stunt to promote the single which is not really doing well.
that's some thought, they might just be aware what's what their doing
true because it all started on the starboy single release day,so might have been planned.
i'm not swayed though, i still don't like either of them,staying true to my raggae root hehe
oyeah rastaman hahaha
i wouldn't mind that hahaha
