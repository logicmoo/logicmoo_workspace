Did you like more of the Beatles earlier recordings, or did you prefer the later music?
Actually i liked some of the early stuff and some of the later material.  I definitely liked songs such as "I Want to Hold your Hand," but i also loved "Let it Be," and "Long and Winding Road."  So I liked early and later recordings.
Me too...I also liked a lot of the stuff that I guess could be called the "middle years."  I'm referring to albums like "Rubber Soul" and "Revolver."
I know what you mean.  You're talking about songs like "Yellow Submarine" and "Eight Days a Week."  great stuff!
What is your favorite Beatles album?
I'd say "Sargeant Pepper" is my favorite, but the "white album" is a close second.  I consider "Sgt. Pepper" a legendary album.
I actually remember the day i bought that album.  It had all those "cut outs" and pictures along with the actual record.  Of course this was during the days of vinyl records, long before compact discs.
Do you remember the album called "Magical Mystery Tour?" I don't think it was one of the more famous albums; it had some of their singles on it, and as i recall some pretty weird stuff.
I am familiar with that album.  "Magical Mystery Tour," in addition to being an album, was a not very successful television movie the group did.
No kidding; i didn't know that.  I think the song "Hello Goodbye" was on that album.  I really liked that song.  I enjoyed our chat about the greatest group ever.
