I feel like going to the movies this weekend. How about you?
It sounds like a good idea, what are you thinking of seeing?
I've been wanting to see the new Pirates of the Carribbean movie.
Oh, I'm not too sure about that.
Why not?
Well, the last one was not very good. It wasn't the same without Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly.
But Johnny Depp was still in it. He makes the whole series!
I know, but it just seems like there was too much of just his antics and no real story.
I can agree with you on that one; they tried to make it more humorous and it did not really work
Yeah, even Ian McShane couldn't save that one.
Agreed, but this one actually brings back Bloom and Knightly.
Really? They brought them back?
Oh yeah, I guess Disney thought the same thing about On Stranger Tides and decided to bring them back.
But isn't their story over? Bloom's Will Turner is now the captain of the Flying Dutchman and they're married, what more can they do?
I'm not sure, but I saw the previews for this one and this looks promising.
I'm still a little worried about this. They've already done four movies
Well, they are planning on making a couple of more after Dead Men Tell No Tales.
Really?! They are going to run this series into the ground!
I can see what you are seeing, but this one may help strengthen the fanchise again.
Well, I'm still not sure, but I'll be willing to go see it. When do you want to go?
