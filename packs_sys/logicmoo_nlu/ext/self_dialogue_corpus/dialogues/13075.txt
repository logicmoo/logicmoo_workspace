I think Rogue One was a great example of taking an obscure but vital reference in A New Hope and turning it into a dynamite action film.
I disagree. I think in filming Rogue One they were straining for plot ideas.
But just think of it: it's the archetypical story of a group of misfits who sacrifice themselves for high ideals.
I have to admit that you're right about that. And Jyn certainly makes a compelling character.
Of course. She's the classic hero figure who finds her calling and sacrifices everything else to fulfil it.
Maybe, but I don't like the ending. It's too harsh; Everyone gets killed.
They make the ultimate sacrifice. What's wrong with that? And isn't it awesome at the end that the story ties in to giving the Deathstar plans to Princess Lia?
Yes, it was nice to tie it in to A New Hope in that way. But the way they used CGI to simulate Carrie Fisher didn't work well.
I know. For me too that kind of spoiled that final scene. But I have to look at it in perspective. They did the best they could.
Maybe they did. At least it did successfully link this movie to the series.
