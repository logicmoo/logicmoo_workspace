In the Force Awakens movie, Rey seems to have such a strong natural connection to the Force. Why do you think that is?
It's a big mystery so far. Do you have any theories?
I think she might be related to any of the Jedi's from the previous movies. They were hunted to extinction but there still might be some people who are force sensitive.
But her sensitivity seems stronger than most. There must be some special reason behind that.
With what has been revealed to us regarding the Force, there doesn't really have to be. Maybe they will link her to someone of importance.
Who do you think she could be linked to?
There are all kinds of theories. Some will insist that she is related to Obi-Wan, but it just doesn't add up with the timeline.
Why do you think she can hear voices when she was near Luke's lightsaber?
I would attribute that to her Force sensitivity and the Force spirits having had some kind of connection with Luke.
That's a possibility, I guess we will get to know more in the upcoming movie.
