Thriller movies from 1987 I'm gonna tell you about the movie called the Step Father my pal get ready for this Thriller story..
Cool i heard about the movie but don't know for sure if iv'e seen this type of Thriller movie maybe you haven't stated telling me about the movie yet.
Okay would you like me to get us a bite to snack on first there is some popcorn in the cabinet.
Sure get the popcorn and i will grab a soda from out the fridge then you can begin.
The movie is starring Jerry Blake but plays a role as the name of Terry a family working man. He happens to have a numerous of wives he married and then murders them.
Gosh you always get to see the good ones. This movie has made many continuous remakes right.
Yes but this Thriller from 1987 is one of the best at least i think so. He gets the children curious of him by acting a bit Psychotic.
That's right he don't want the wives friend's and kids to know who he really is and that he is a serial killer. He tricks them all into thinking he is a great man.
Sort of correct but however his lovely widow Susan Shelley hack and her daughter find out that he has continuously murdered past tense wives and after their marriage he tries to kill her but failed to succeed.
Great Thriller movie the kind people like to re watch repeats over and over let's do this again sometime.
