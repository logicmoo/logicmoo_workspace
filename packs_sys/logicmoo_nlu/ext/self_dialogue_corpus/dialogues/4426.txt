I think Alfred HItchcock was the greatest creator of thriller movies ever.  Were you a fan of HItchcock?
I'm not sure i'd call him the greatest, but I will say he is certainly among the best.  He was a genius, no doubt about it.
I'll never forget the first time i saw "the Birds."  I've never been so frightened watching a movie.
That was a great movie, but to me "Psycho" was HItchcock's best.  That was incredibly scary.
"Pyscho" was scary, but i think i give the edge to "the Birds" because it was in color.  I've always had a problem getting involved with black and white films.
It's interesting you say that; i always thought the fact that "Pyscho" was in black and white actually added to the tension.
Do you remember any of the sequels to "Psycho?" I think i saw one of them; it was awful.
I think there were three "Psycho" sequels and i saw all of them.  I'll tell you the truth...they were all terrible.  But i think everyone had false expectations in feelling they could be even half as good as the original.
Did you know that when "Psycho" first opened in the theatres in 1960, people were not allowed into the theatre after the film had started?
Now that you mention it, i did read that somewhere.  HItchcock got some good publicity out of that.  He wanted everyone to watch every second of it; once it started you couldn't get in.  great strategy !
