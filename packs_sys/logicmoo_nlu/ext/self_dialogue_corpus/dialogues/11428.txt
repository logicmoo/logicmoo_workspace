Tell me something about the Beatles that you thought was questionable, or very different about their music.
I always thought that their travelling to India was pretty weird.
Why did you think that?
Well, I used to wonder why George Harrison got into Indian music. I mean, did he just meet up with Ravi Shankar and jam with him, and decide to become an Indian swami himself?
Do you think that was wrong?
I thought they were all way to drugged out and just wanted to go to India to get their hands on some far-out opium or something like that.
Did you believe that they were using drugs? Drugs like opium, or heroin?
I think that they were tripping a lot, dropping tons of acid, and that they wanted a different sort of head. And they couldn't do that legally in England or America, so they traveled to where they could get it easily.
Does that make them bad in your eyes?
I was too young to really understand drug use. I only knew it was bad, and I thought they they were being led astray by foreigners from far-off lands.
