With the Miami Dolphins Tight ends, the big question is Julius Thomas.
No question about it.  Miami traded for him in the off-season, but will they get the player from Denver or Jacksonville.
They are definitely hoping for the player who caught 24 touchdowns his last two years in Denver.
Yes, he did that in an offense led by Adam Gase, just like he has in Miami.
But that team also had Peyton Manning.  Without him he had two bad years in Jacskonville.
True.  But while Tannehill certainly is no Peyton Manning, he is much better than what they have in Jacksonville.
Was it just the touchdowns that were a concern in Jacksonville?
There are some major concerns.  Every year since 2013 he has played fewer games and averaged fewer yards per catch.
And fewer receptions.
Almost, he caught three more in 2015 than in 2014, but then 16 fewer in 2016.  He only caught more than 50 passes once.
So he is a big risk, they really don't know what they are getting.
No, they don't, and there are some concerns that he does not seem to be building a rapport with Tannehill.
So, what is the fallback if he doesn't pan out?
There is not much of one.  MarQueis Gray had a couple good games, but he does not seem to be much of an option.
What about Thomas Duarte?
Some people had high hopes for him, but he still needs to develop before he can contribute.
They brought old vet Anthony Fasano back.
Yes, but he is there mostly to block at this point.
But he could end up playing on a lot of downs.
If Thomas doesn't pan out, it will be a lot of Fasano and sets with no tight end.
