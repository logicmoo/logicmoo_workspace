Hey! Do you know if there's any good thrillers playing at the cinema right now?
I think The Mummy's still playing, if you haven't seen that yet.
I haven't! That's the new Tom Cruise movie, right?
Yes. It's also got Russell Crowe playing a character called Dr. Henry Jekyll, and Annabelle Wallis playing a monster-hunting archaeologist called Jennifer Halsey.
Sounds good! But do you think I'll be able to follow the plot even if I haven't seen the previous Mummy movies?
Definitely, it's standard. Tom Cruise plays a soldier of fortune called Nick Morton, who goes around the Middle East looting ancient treasures. He digs up the wrong tomb, and thrilling adventures ensue.
Haha, got it. Well, it sounds good! I love anything that involves ancient mythology and some daring escapism.
Me too. Plus, Russell Crowe is one of my favorites. I love anything he does.
Agreed, me too. I'm not much of a Tom Cruise fan, but I'll see anything with Russell Crowe.
Great! Let's find a time to go this week! If we go to an afternoon showing, it probably won't give us nightmares.
