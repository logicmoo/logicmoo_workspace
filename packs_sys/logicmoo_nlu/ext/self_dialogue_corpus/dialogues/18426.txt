Do you have a favorite rap artist?
Yeah, I'd definitely say Drake is my favorite artist of all time. How about you?
I'm a really big fan of Lil Wayne and also Kid Cudi, they're both really great.
That's awesome, you have good taste! Is rap your favorite genre?
Rap is for sure my favorite genre. A close second would be hip hop or pop.
Who's your favorite pop artist? I really like The Chainsmokers.
Yeah they've got some good stuff. And also Bruno Mars is awesome.
I'm telling you! He had a song on the radio a while back and I could have sworn the first time hearing it that it was Michael Jackson.
I'd say he's this generation's Michael Jackson for sure. Do you like edm?
EDM is all right, some of the festivals are cool. I'll listen to Dubstep sometimes.
Dubstep was okay but it seems to be a trend that has passed. I'll also listen to some rock sometimes.
What rock artists do you like? Classic or newer stuff?
I like a few of the older artists like White Snake, The Eagles, and The Strokes. But I also like a few newer artists like Papa Roach and Muse.
Yeah I guess you could consider those "new". Comparatively I guess.
Absolutely, I love them. Papa Roach puts on a very good live show.
I've listened to some of The Strokes, but I've never listened to much Papa Roach beyond what I've heard on the radio.
Oh they're worth it, you should check out their newest album.
Do you like Avenged Sevenfold? They're one of my favorite rock artists.
Oh I love them! Great taste, their guitar riffs are insane.
You've got that right. Man I do love their style.
