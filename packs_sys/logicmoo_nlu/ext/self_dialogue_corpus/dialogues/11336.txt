Do you have a favorite sequence of Beatles songs on a studio album.
Oh, you know I do. It's on Abbey Road, does that give it away?
I can actually think of a few great sequences on that album. Which one is the best?
She Came In Through The Bathroom Window into Golden Slumbers into Carry that Weight.
Right! Those songs flow together so incredibly well!
I know, it's a brilliant transition musically. It doesn't feel forced at all. What song transitions did you have in mind?
I was thinking of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band into With a Little Help from My Friends into Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. It's such a great range of pop songs.
Yes, and it shows that even the doofy Ringo could write a great song.
Oh man, it has been a long time since I've listened to Sgt. Pepper. I think this year is the fiftieth anniversary.
I think you're right. It came out in 1967 so that would make fifty years.
