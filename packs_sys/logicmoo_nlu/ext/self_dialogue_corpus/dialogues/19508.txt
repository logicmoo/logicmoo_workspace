Hey, so what do you think of Christina Aguilera's music?
Oh, I like her music!  She had some great dance songs.
Yes she did, like Genie in a Bottle and What a Girl Wants.
When were those released?
Oh gosh, it was her debut album.  It was in 1999 I think.
Did you know she was also on the Mickey Mouse Club show, just like Britney Spears?
Yeah I had heard that.  They were contemporaries, weren't they?
Yes, they both released their albums at the same time.  I liked Christina better though.
How many albums did she end up releasing?
I have heard of seven.  Her last one was in 2012 so not too long ago.
That was Lotus, wasn't it?
Yes.  She's gotten five Grammy awards and a Latin Grammy too.
I didn't even know such a thing existed.
Yeah, kinda neat.  I think she's a very impressive pop star.
The Pop Star Princess, as they say.
Yeah I'd heard that too.  I think she's had some children now, hasn't she?
Yeah I believe so.  Billboard said she was one of the 20 most successful artists of the 2000s.
That's crazy!  I guess she was extremely popular.
She still is.  She hasn't faded out of popularity yet.
No, I guess she hasn't.
