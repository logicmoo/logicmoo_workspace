Darth Vader could have kicked Palpatine's butt if he wanted to.
Nah.  Force lightning would fry his suit, just like it did in Jedi.  At best, it would be a mutual kill.
Vader didn't have his saber then, and was missing one hand.  If he has his saber, he'd have been able to block it, just like Windu.
Windu knew Vaapad.  Vader doesn't.
He could have mastered Vaapad. And besides, you don't need Vaapad to block lightning, or to absorb it.
Vader couldn't have mastered Vaapad. Vaapad requires you to skirt the dark side, Vader jumped all the way in.
He could still absorb it.
He couldn't absorb it with his hands, because they're mechanical.  They'd be fried.
The force doesn't care if it's mechanical or not, he could absorb Han's blaster bolt with his hand.
The blaster bolt wasn't electricity, though.
