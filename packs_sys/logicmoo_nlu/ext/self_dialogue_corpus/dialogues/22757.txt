I think we are due for another Joy Luck Club.
Do you think? It has been a while since there was movie about Asian culture.
Yeah, I see the moms in that movie and it reminds of me of grandmother and her sisters. You know she had 9 of them.
You're kidding. Big family. And a lot of sisters.
Yeah, each sister is just like one of Aunties. One was very much the perfectionist, another very critical, one down on her luck....they all complained about each other as much as they loved each other.
That's just family. Did you have history of your family coming over from China like the movie?
You know we didn't. I'm 4th generation. My grandmother who I loved dearly was torn between cultures just like mothers. They want to adopt American culture but the Chinese part is so rooted in them.
Wow! 4th gen. That's crazy. Do you think the movie depicted Chinese American families accurately?
They kind of did. I guess. There is a good bit of conflict between generations. The older people just don't know how to make peace with the new world.
I can see that. It's probably ingrained in them.
Yeah, it is. And Chinese culture is about a lot of guilt. It's hard for them to adjust.
But it seems like food always brings people back together.
Yeah, meals are very important. We ate at my grandmother's house every Sunday.
Every Sunday?
Yep, without fail she cooked for her 3 sons, their wives and the 11 grandchildren.
Holy cow! That's a lot of work. Bet you had great food.
Yep, nothing like a Chinese home cooked meal. As the movie can protest. The mom's take a lot of pride in their cooking.
And crafty mah-jong playing according to the movies.
Well, we didn't do that part.
Too bad it looks fun. After seeing the movie I wanted to play!
