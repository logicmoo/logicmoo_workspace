What do you think about the Patriots winning the Super Bowl last year?
I thought they were the best team coming in and their comeback in the second half was unbelievable.
Did you think they had a chance when they got down against the Falcons?
I really didn't once it became 28-3. That's a tall hill to climb and they hadn't shown any signs that they would come back.
They somehow got it going and made the plays they needed to.
Yes, the Falcons did make some poor play calls that helped, but the Patriots took advantage of every opportunity.
What do you think of the reputation of the Patriots as cheaters?
I think they were wrong in recording signals like they did several years ago, but I think the ball inflation/deflation was a big story about nothing.
Lots of people don't view their championships as being legitimate because of those scandals.
The thing is that it can never be proven that another team would have won if the Patriots hadn't done the things they were accused of.
I guess that's true, but I think it casts a cloud on them.
I think their championships are legitimate because they did win those on the field.
It just makes me wonder because if they were really confident in themselves they wouldn't need to cheat.
Maybe but I also think if you look at the results from the past several years they've shown how good they are.
Do you think they can win again next year?
Yes because I don't see Brady slowing down at all and Belichick is a great coach.
The Dolphins are going to be better next year, then there's the Steelers and Chiefs to contend with.
I think the AFC East is a bunch of patsies and the Patriots will walk all over them. They might get a challenge from the Raiders or one of the teams you mentioned though.
Yes, the Raiders. I think they may take that next step this year, them against the Patriots would be a great game.
We did miss out last year when Carr got hurt because a Raiders vs. Patriots match up would be a lot of fun.
