There are so many things to like about Star Wars - I'm talking about the original.
Yes, of course, the first trilogy will always be the best.
What is one of your favorite elements of Star Wars?
I loved the soundtrack by John Williams. It was stupendous and creative and just about perfect.
I think it complemented the film very well.
I like that Williams created specific musical themes for different characters, like Leia's theme, and that goofy theme for the jawas.
And of course there was Ben Kenobi's theme. Very noble.
I bought the soundtrack and listened to it a million times. I had it memorized.
I did too. Now I can't listen to the music without seeing scenes from the film in my mind's eye.
I think that is the mark of a great soundtrack - it is forever linked to the movie it complements.
