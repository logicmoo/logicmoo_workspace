What's your pick for most underrated horror film?
That's really tough and there's a few I would consider, how about Nightmare On Elm Street 4?
Not a bad choice at all, one of the stronger sequels.
Agreed fully it's not up to par with part 3, or New Nightmare, but feel it's the best aside from those two.
One things for sure, it tramples all over The Dream Child or Freddy's dead.
Yeah those two were pretty bad, as was part 2.
Part 2 would actually be among my most disappointing films. They had a such a classic character and they follow up the first film with that?
Thankfully they recovered and came out with Dream Warriors next.
Great point, I do love that movie and it was a really nice touch when Nancy came back.
Yeah but at the end when Freddy killed her? Excruciating to watch.
