I haven't heard much of anything good on the radio these days.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I usually listen the country station or the "oldies" 80's/90's station.
Oldies makes us sound too old!  I do love the sounds they play on there though. I heard some good Phil Collins and Bonnie Taylor the other day.
Oh I love Total Eclipse of the Heart!  That's one crazy video!
Speaking of videos, I used to love to watch MTV when I was a kid. Loved that Milli Vanilli video.
Me too!  I'd also have a blank tape ready to record the radio. Boy how things have changed.
What's your favorite song of all time or favorite group?
Gotta be Aerosmith - mid 90's or even 80's.  I love Dream On.
That has got to be one of the best songs of all time. I also really like Cryin' and Amazing.  Janie's got a gun is great too.
I like to go back even further with Angel.
What about country music?  Do you have a favorite?
I like the older stuff - Chris LeDoux, Garth Brooks, Sawyer Brown.
Those are great. I think one of my all time favorites of any music has got to be the great Simon & Garfunkle.
Oh, they are amazing!  I do love a lot of Paul Simon's solo songs too - especially Graceland.
The Graceland album is one of the best albums of all time. So many good songs.
And so original too. Ladysmith Black Mambazo was so good.
How about CCR?  Do you like their stuff?
Credence Clearwater Revival - for sure!  Who'll stop the rain?  Amazing!
I just don't feel like today's music doesn't have  the same soul - hey! I sound like a song myself!
I like that Old Time Rock & Roll!!!
