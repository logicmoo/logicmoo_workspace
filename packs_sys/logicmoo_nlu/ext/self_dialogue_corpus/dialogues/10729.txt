What's your favorite scene out of all the Fast & the Furious movies?
Can't believe you're asking this question, but everyone's favorite scene should be Brian and Dom's first race...
That honestly feels like sooo long ago! Refresh my memory, I haven't watched the orginial movie in years.
Brian's an undercover cop and tries to infiltrate Dom's shop to catch a group of street racer theives. Dom doesn't take kindly to Brian snooping around but Brian challenges Dom to a street race, something Dom cannot turn down.
I remember now! That scene really was epic. It laid the groundwork for all the movies that followed. Crazy.
Dom and Brian aren't close friends yet but the core dynamic of their relationship is established with that one race. Really set the pace for everything.
What did Brian tell Dom at the end of that first race?
Brian shouted, "Dude, I almost had you!" with Dom responding in typical Dom fashion saying, "You almost had me? You never had me. You never had your car! Granny shifting, not double clutching like you should...you’re lucky that hundred shot of NOS didn’t blow the welds on the intake...you almost had me?"
Even with Dom humiliating Brian after that first race he still seems fond of Brian’s competitive energy.
Brian and Dom were like a match made in heaven. All together a great duo.
