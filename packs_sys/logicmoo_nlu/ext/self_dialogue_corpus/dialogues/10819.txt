Man, can you believe they've come out with eight Fast & Furious movies?
Hey man, if it works, I don't see why they should stop making them. Fast 7 and the Fate of the Furious both grossed over a billion dollars.
Jeez, don't you think they're kind of milking the franchise? I mean, I can't see them making any more movies without Paul Walker.
Not really, if it's not broken, don't fix it. Anyways, do you happen to have a favorite Fast & Furious movie?
Honestly, I really like the first The Fast and the Furious movie. I have vivid memories of it because my dad took me to see it on my birthday.
Good choice man, but I'd have to say Fast 7 was my favorite movie. I really like the soundtrack too, See You Again is a great song.
Don't you think that song is a little played out? Charlie Puth sounds like generic pop to me.
I think that's a little disrespectful to say man, the song is a real touching tribute to Paul Walker's memory. Brian will forever be immortalized by that song.
No disrespect to Paul Walker, I'm just a little tired of hearing that song everyday on the radio.
I see what you mean, and respect your entitlement to an opinion. If they keep coming out with movies, I'll keep watching them till Fast 70 is out and I'm an 82-year-old grandpa!
