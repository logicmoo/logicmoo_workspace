What do you like about superhero movies?
Well I grew up reading comic books about superheros so of course I would love the movies.
Me too!  How about you...ya got a preference between DC and Marvel movies?
Marvel movies all the way!  I mean DC is cool with Superman and Batman but that's about their biggest.  Marvel has way more cool characters.
I agree!  The Marvel Universe is already amazing and it still expanding!  DC is definitely behind on that front.  They waited too long to get started into making movies.
I agree!  I do like their tv shows though such as the Flash and Arrow.  Those are really cool!
Me too!  Nothing beats Smallville though!
Yes! That was the show back in the day!
Definitely!  Right now, I can't wait to see Spider-man Homecoming!  That is going to be so good!
I gree!  Then I'll have to wait to see the new Hulk movie too!  It looks so diffrent from the others.  I can't wait!
