What do you think about Lady Gaga?
I love the jazz music she does with Tony Bennett.
I don't like those songs. I like her Pop Songs.
I admit her Pop Songs are better than the stuff on the radio now but not as good as her covers of the classic American song book.
I think that Poker Face is one of the best pop songs since Madonna.
See, I thought she was a wannabe Madonna before I heard her jazz songs.
What do you think of Joanne.
Eh. Not bad but not great.
Well, we agree on something.
I would rather hear her pop music though.
