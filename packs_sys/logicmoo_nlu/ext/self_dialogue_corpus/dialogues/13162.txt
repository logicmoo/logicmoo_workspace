What do you think was the worst thing about the Star Wars prequels?
I think it was Jar Jar Binks. He was too goofy.
Really? I thought the problems were much deeper than that.
What do you mean?
The characters were all terrible. Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Queen Amidala were flat and had no personality.
Oh, that makes sense. I hadn't thought about it like that.
And furthermore, the plots were boring. There was so much talk about trade routes and the Galactic Senate and other dull things.
Yes, I suppose you're right. The original movies were a classic "hero's journey" arc, but these were a mess.
I think the new sequel trilogy is off to a better start.
I think so, too. I hope they continue to evoke the spirit of the original trilogy.
