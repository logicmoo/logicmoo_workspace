I love movies don't i honey you seem to love them too so did you ever see that movie I spit on your grave?
Yes it was so serious I enjoyed the movie but i did not like the parts when those men took that woman to their country and set her up.
Yeah they set her up inside her apartment all because she wouldn't expose herself by taking nude photos.
They then drugged the poor woman and brutally beat her then took her off to their country and held her hostage.
It was awful how they killed her friend and then when they got her to their country they were injuring her more and more.
The sad part was all the rapes and beatings she took and how that awful woman and those friends of theirs they were all in on this crime.
So she tried to escape many times but ended up right back there because they were all up to know good holding her hostage.
They planned on killing her but then she finally gets away and she goes out to take revenge.
Oh yeah she got them all back one by one and they got to see how it felt to be abused raped and beaten like this she made them all feel the pain she felt.
And was finally able to head back for the Embassy and get out of that country it never showed her arrive back home.
