Which do you prefer, old Incubus or new Incubus.
Old Incubus. Hands down.
Me too. I feel like after the Science album, they totally sold out!
I liked the Morning View album a lot, but yeah its totally different than Science.
I just don't understand how you go from crazy funk to...whatever they are now.
Maybe Brandon had all the funk in his dreads, so when he cut them off, he cut out the funk.
Pun intended?
Maybe a little bit.
I mean, I understand wanting to make it as an artist, but I can't understand changing your whole musical style.
I don't know, I kind of get it.
How so?
Well, let me ask you, do you like only one kind of music?
You know I listen to everything.
Exactly. I'm sure those guys do too. Maybe they just felt it was time for a change.
A change is one thing, this is an entire turn around!
Well, you're not wrong, but I think as long as they're still making music and getting it out there, you have to at least respect them.
I guess so.
I'd give at least Morning View another chance, I think you could really like it.
You think so?
Yeah, I do, just take the time to listen to not just how the songs are played, but the meaning behind the lyrics.
