I read about Gigantic which has a fantasy storyline.
What is it about and what is it based on?
The idea seems to be from Jack and the Beanstalk and has Jack as the main character.
What happens in the movie?
Well, he meets giants in the sky as the name suggests.
Sounds like a fun premise. What else?
He meets a 11 year-old girl who is around 60 ft tall!
Do they become friends?
it seems so, must be difficult for Jack to be around all those really tall people.
It would be scary, I guess.
