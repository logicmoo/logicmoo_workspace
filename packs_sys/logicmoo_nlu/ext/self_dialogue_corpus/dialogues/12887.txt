The most iconic and worthwhile Star Wars films are the first three.
I agree. These worked well because of the way George Lucas adapted the philosopy of Joseph Campbell in the characters.
That's right. It especially works in Luke Skywalker's origin story in A New Hope.
Don't forget the characterization of Obi Wan as the wise man that Luke goes to for answers.
Of course. And what about the archetypical villian in the character of Darth Vader?
I think, though, that that really comes out in The Empire Strikes Back, when Darth Vader reveals himself as Luke's father.
Isn't that one of the greatest surprise endings in cineme? It blew me away when I first saw that.
Me too. But I have to say I have a partiality for The Return of the Jedi. It's so much fun.
I don't know if I agree. The tightest of the three is The Empire Strikes Back - interestingly the only one of them that Lucas didn't direct.
Wait. Did he direct The Return of the Jedi? Anyway, all things said, that trilogy sure is a classic of cinema.
