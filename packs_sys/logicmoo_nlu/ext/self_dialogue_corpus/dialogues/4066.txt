Have you seen all the Mission Impossible movies?
for sure, how could I miss Tom Cruise's stun, it's too visually exhilarating
that's for sure, especially the one where he's climbing the tallest tower in the world--Raj Khalifa
oh, that one really got me on the edge of seat, especially later I realized it was real stunt, not CG
yea, Tom Cruise always tend to do stunt himself, and for that I really respect him
you know in the next movie, he jumped into a water cooling server center to hihack their data?
yeah, he was blacked out when holding breath for too long
I read news later that he was actually trained to hold breath more than 3 minutes under water by some specialists from SEAL
you mean the SEAL from USA special force?
yea
