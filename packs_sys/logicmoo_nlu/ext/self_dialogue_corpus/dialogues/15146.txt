Who are you listening to right now?
Oh, I've got an old Luke Bryan CD playing.
I liked some of his stuff, but his newer stuff seems a lot less country.
I think you could say that about all country music in general.
I guess so, it seems like pop and country are getting closer and closer every year.
You don't like the crossover? Too much of a purist?
I think there is value in both, but what is Kid Rock doing making country music, or Nelly?
I think its great that its becoming more popular, everybody loves trucks and cowboy boots.
There used to be more to country than trucks and girls and boots.
I think at its core, country was always about those things.
I don't know that I agree. There is that old saying about what you get if you play a country song backwards.
Your dog, truck, and house back? That's exactly what I'm saying.
I think there used to be more emotion in country. It was more about the feelings and lifestyle than just the boots.
Maybe, but there's barely any country in some country music.
I don't know if it gets any moer country than "Drinkin beer and Wastin Bullets".
I don't know that song.
It's an older Luke Bryan. It's about deer hunting.
Well that is pretty country, but its still recreational. It's not living off the land.
Um, deer are off the land. And if you get one, you get to eat it.
I just think country used to be about homesteads and heartbreak, not one night stands and hangovers.
