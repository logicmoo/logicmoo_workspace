Who's your favorite Beatle?
That's a hard one - I know most people would say John or Paul, but I like George
Really? why George? He didnt really get to do many songs with the Beatles.
But the ones he did get to make were my favorites especially "Something"
"Something" is a great song for sure. I like stuff like "Revolution #9"
Well which album is your favorite? I like "Rubber Soul"
Mine would be the White Album or Sgt. Pepper. - those are great albums.
Yeah they are really good but you can't be Rubber Soul - its the transition album that made the Beatles more experimental.
True. Its quite different from those early records.
Yeah, thats why it's my favorite - you can really measure the growth in songwriting with this album.
