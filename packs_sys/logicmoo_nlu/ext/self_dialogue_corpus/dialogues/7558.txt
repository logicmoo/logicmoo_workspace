Have you seen the Harry Potter moves yet?
Yes, all of them. Have you?
Yes. I think the first movie and the sixth movie are the best.
Yeah. Half-Blood Prince was my favorite.
I was sad when Dumbledore died.
So was I, but I had just read the book so I was expecting it.
I also really liked the first movie.
I think that was the movie that best captured the book.
Agreed. What was your favorite thing the movie did that the book didn't.
The music. That tone will forever play in my head when I think of Harry Potter.
