So, you seen any good movies recently?
Well, I've been on a Pixar binge recently.
Oh I love their films!
Me too! Though they haven't been as good recently.
True. What's your favourite.
Well, I have at least three--but I really like Wall-e.
Wall-e is so cute!
I actually know a guy that worked on the animation.
Really? That's neat. I'm amazed by how much information about the characters they gave you with so little dialogue.
Yeah, it's hard to believe Wall-e never says a word except "eva."
It's the very definition of showing and not telling in film.
I remember going to see it; it's actually the first Pixar film I saw in theaters.
No kidding? That's cool. What are the other two?
Well, out of the newer ones I thought Inside Out was fantastic.
Oh my goodness, I cried so much. It was a great representation of what depression feels like.
And I loved how they validated both the importance of Joy and Sadness together.
The music, by Giacchino, was a real tear jerker too.
And then the third favourite Pixar film is Toy Story 3.
Oh, I wept during that one. My older brother was going off to college that year.
Aw, that's so sweet. It's such a good conclusion to Toy Story.
