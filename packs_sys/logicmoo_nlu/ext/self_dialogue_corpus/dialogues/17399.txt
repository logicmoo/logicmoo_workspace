What do you think about Beyonce?
She is cool but I liked her better when she was in a group.
What group was she in?
She used to be the lead singer for Destiny's Child.
I've never heard of them before. What songs do they sing?
I can't believe you've never heard of Destiny's Child. They were one of the biggest groups in the 90's and early 2000's. Some of their songs are "Indendepent Women", "Survivor", "No, no, no"
I think I remember that "Survivor" song. I didn't realize Beyonce used to be in that group. What happened to them?
Beyonce was always the lead singer. She decided she wanted to pursue a solo career and the group fell apart.
Do you think the group might get back together one day?
I'm not sure. She's making too much money as a solo artist and as the wife of Jay-Z.
I know they have done a lot of songs together. What is your favorite song they have done together?
I really like Dangerously in Love.
The song or the album?
Both, but I was talking about the song because Jay-Z is rapping on it.
I heard that Jay-Z cheated on Beyonce and that's why her sister and him were fighting in the elevator.
Who is her sister?
Have you ever heard of Solange? That's Beyonce's younger sister. She has had a few hits too.
I didn't know that Solange was her sister but they do resemble each other now that you say something.
Yes I really like Solange's music. The lyrics are more meaningful than what Beyonce is singing about.
I think that's because Beyonce falls into the Pop/R&B category while Solange is more of old R&B. She just won a Grammy Award for "Cranes in the Sky."
