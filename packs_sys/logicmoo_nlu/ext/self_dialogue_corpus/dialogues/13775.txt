What do you think of Lady Gaga?
I absolutely love Lady Gaga!
Me too. When she first came out, I didn't think she was that good though.
I know. I always thought her songs were catchy, but I didn't realize she had as much talent until more recently.
When I first realized she could really sing was during her Sound of Music medley as a tribute to Julie Andrews.
Yes! It is the same for me. Even though I'd heard her to jazz with Tony Bennett, it was that performance that had me hooked.
Then two years ago she was amazing during the Star Spangled Banner at the Super Bowl and this year she put on a great half time show.
I know. I thought she was exceptional.
I'm really hoping to see her on her upcoming Joanne tour.
I have my tickets and I can't wait to go.
