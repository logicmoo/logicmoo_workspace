Hey, was just jamming out to Paul Simon's "Graceland" album. Have you heard it?
Yes, I think so. Wasn't there a song on it called, "Diamonds on the Souls of her Shoes?"
Yes, that one is good. There's a lot of great music on that album. Wonder what Paul Simon is producing now?
He married Eddie Brickell. She had that hit "What I Am" a hundred years ago. Good tune.
Wonder if the two of them every made albums together. I always liked "What I am."
Great dance tune. Art Garfunkel, I think he's been out of music for a very long time... I think Garfunkel wasn't happy with Simon.
Simon did go on to be very successful. Wonder what the Police think of Sting now.
Yes, he clearly went on to fame and creativity musically. Sting's solo albums are some of his best work.
Sting really matured into amazing talent, for sure. He's been relevant for a long time musically.
His songs tend to be sad and melancholy though. Remember "Wrapped Around Your Finger?"
