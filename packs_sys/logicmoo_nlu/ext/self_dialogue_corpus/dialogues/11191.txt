Did you see her shoes?
Who, Emma's shoes?
Yes!
They looked like Valentino's, with the red soles, just perfect!
Yesssss, it would be a dream to own a pair of those.
Yes, it would! Did you see their make up too?!
It looks like they used either MakeUp Forever or it could have been Nars, or maybe MAC
And the eyelash extensions! They really help open up their eyes.
I hear that man buns are really in now too. The thing where guys pull their hair back on top into a mini bun thing. Have you seen that?
Yes! I kinda like how it looks, it has to be the right kind of guy to pull of the look.
Who has the the look to pull it off? Hmmm maybe Jared Leto?
Yeah, definitely. What other fashion trends did you see at the Oscars that you liked?
A lot of people had neat highlights, the new ombre thing from dark to light is a pretty cool new look.
Yeah! I would do that look if I had the money to support it, haha.
Same here! Did you see that all the celebrities wore jewelry by Baccarat? It also looked like they had Swarovski diamonds on their shoes, and dresses.
Bling is super in right now, so is rose gold metallic.
True. Did you like seeing Kim Kardashian's sister's new revenge body? I couldn't believe how good she looked in that Oscar de la Renta dress.
She looked awesome! Must be nice to have so much help in having a personal trainer and private chefs.
Yeah agreed.. I love seeing the fashion, it's so fun! The Oscars is like prom for celebrities.
Totally. It's always fun to see who wore what best.
