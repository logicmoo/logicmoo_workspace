Have you seen the Disney movie Moana yet?
Yes, and I absolutely loved it. how about you?
I took my niece out to see it a week ago. I think I was more into it then her.
Moana was such a breath of fresh air in regards to Disney movies.
I loved how they portrayed so much beautiful Polynesian culture and heritage.
Me too. I would top Moana as one of my favorites next to Disney's Brave. And I loved how they used the Rock as one of the voice actors.
Of course, he has a great voice and was well suited for Maui.
I cracked up with scenes with Maui and Moana's chicken. Could never get enough of those two. Do you think they will ever come out with a Moana 2?
I don't know, but I can hope. It seems they left a lot of story that could be told in a Moana sequel.
I couldn't agree more.
