Have you ever seen the movie Death Wish 3?
No, tell me about it
Charles Bronson plays a man named Paul Kersey, a architect turned vigilante.
How'd that happen?
His wife was murdered and his daughter raped, then in the second film his daughter is raped again then murdered.
I take he didn't tell either situation well.
Nope, he was a Korean war vet and he hunted down and killed all the ones responsible in both previous films.
So what's going on in this one?
Paul is visiting a old war buddy in New york, but a brutal street gang has taken over the neighborhold. They kill this old buddy of his and Pauls gets arrested for it.
Okay, so what happens next?
Ed Lauter, who is a police inspector, recognizes who Kersey is. He makes a deal with him, take out as much of the gang as he can and see the police get credited with the decrease in crime.
Sounds, interesting, so what does Kersey do?
First, he designs and builds a couple of anti-gang body traps for the old war buddy's apartment building, which he moves into.
Booby traps, what kind of booby traps.
One is a piece of drywall with nails in it and another is a board rigged on a spring that shoots up into the face of anybody trying to enter a specific window
What happens after that?
He then buys a car and leaves on the street. When two gang members try to steal it and threaten him with a knife, he shoots both of them.
Kind of a bait car situation, but wihtout the jail trip.
Yep, and eventually he winds up in a massive fire fight with the gang, using a .30 Browning machinegun and masive handcannon.
I love shoot'em ups, I'm in.
