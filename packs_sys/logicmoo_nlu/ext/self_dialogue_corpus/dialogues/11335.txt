Do you think the beatles are the greatest band of all time?
I don't know about that, they have some great hits but the best band ever is a hard title to win!
Come on, who else could have had EVERYONE at the superbowl singing one song like McCartney did with Hey Jude?
That's true! But for every song like Hey Jude that the Beatles had they also had songs like Taxman which were kind of mediocre.
Fair point, however the number of good songs of theirs far outweigh the number of bad.
Don't get me wrong I love the Beatles! I always put on the Revolver album when I need a pump up in the car.
That's a great call, for me I put on the 1's Album and just go back to their hits. Its refreshing and brings me back to a simpler time.
A simpler time? The Beatles wrote about some heavy content. Lady Madonna might sound like a nice and light song but its very deep and emotional.
True but for some reason their voices just relax me. I mean three of the greatest musicians of all time in one band? We'll never see anything like that again.
You mean John, Paul, and George? Thats fair. I guess the Beatles could be considered the best band ever.
