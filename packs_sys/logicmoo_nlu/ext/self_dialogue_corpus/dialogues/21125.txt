What was the last movie you saw?
It was an old one, Anchors Aweigh, with Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra.
Oh, do you like old movies then?
Some of them are really good, others, not so much.  But if you wanted to know the last movie I saw in a theater, it was Hidden Figures.
Hidden Figures?  The title seems familiar, but I don't remember what it's about.
It's about how black women were big contributors at NASA during the Space Race.  It was pretty good.
Oh, yeah, I remember now.  It was good?
Yeah, but I read up a little bit on the history after watching and I wish it had been a little more accurate.
Well, you know how that goes in movies about true events, actual facts are more of a guideline and some of them just don't interest the writer or director or whoever.
I guess, but they interest me.  I mean, Apollo 13 was pretty acurate and it was really exciting even though I knew what was going to happen.
Well, yeah, but the reality was pretty dramatic anyway there and I bet they took some liberties.
I'm sure they did, but not that many, I don't think.  I just think that actual facts can be just as interesting as some things they do for dramatic license.
Maybe, I don't know, you liked Titanic, didn't you?  That had a ton of dramatic license.
Yeah, but I don't think it ever pretended otherwise.  And, of course, there are movies I love that you really have to suspend your disbelief for.
Like what?
Like Speed.  Physics doesn't work like that, it really doesn't.
Oh, come on, that bus could totally make that jump.
No, it couldn't.  But that's okay, in that movie verse it could.
So what you're saying is that sometimes you want movies to be as realistic as they can be and sometimes you want movies with only a passing nod at realism.
Exactly.
