Hey, it's almost football preseason!  Are you excited?
Yes, but I wish it would start a little later in the year.
Absolutely!  It's too hot for football.  I feel sorry for those guys.
For sure, it would also be nice if baseball was over and we could concentrate on football.
Yeah, they should look into starting the season later and extending it into the following year.
It would be awesome if football ran right into baseball and baseball ran right into football so there was no break between.
I don't think they would ever do that but it would be nice.
The Chief's had a pretty quiet offseason, did you follow them?
Not really, like you said, it was quiet but it is basically the same team.
Yeah, 3 general managers in 10 years though, something is going on in the front offices.
Agreed, I think Clark Hunt is involved too much in the dealings of the team.
Yeah, he is not really a football guy so he should probably just let the experts make the decisions.
For sure, he doesn't have the clout that his dad did.
Agreed, his dad basically created the league and invented the superbowl.
Yes, Clark hasn't done anything except inherit the team.
John Dorsey was a great general manager though, they will definitely miss him.
For sure, he had the inside line to a lot of trade deals and had a good relationship with the players.
Especially Jamaal Charles, do you think he will make a comeback this year?
I don't know if they resigned him but he is getting pretty old and there are 3 young running backs behind him.
Speaking of running backs, I hear Adrian Peterson and tearing it up this offseason.
