I liked the original Star Wars movies much better than the prequels.
What didn't you like about the prequels?
Well for one thing, I didn't like Jar Jar Binks as a character. He was sort of annoying.
Yeah, I thought so too, but I liked the third movie in the series, Revenge of the Sith.
I liked that one the best. I especially liked the end with the lightsaber battles and Anakin becoming Darth Vadar.
Yes, that part was pretty powerful. It was definitely cool to see how skilled Yoda was.
Yoda has always been my favorite character. I liked him from the very first time we saw him in Empire Strikes Back.
Yes, I really liked that scene where Luke first met him and thought he was just some annoying animal from that planet.
Right, and then Yoda suddenly says, "I cannot train him." And at that point you realize it is the person Luke has been looking for.
Empire Strikes Back is by far my favorite Star Trek movie, and that scene is part of the reason why.
