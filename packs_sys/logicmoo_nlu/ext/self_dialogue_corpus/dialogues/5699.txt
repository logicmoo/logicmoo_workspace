Did you know that the new Beauty and the Beast movie recently came out on Blu Ray and DVD?
Yes, I actually even pre-ordered it because I wanted it so much!
I love the new songs in this version of the movie.
Which one is your favorite?
I really like the song in the tavern about Gaston, especially the new additions with the lines LeFou adds.
Yes, I like the line where he talks about not being able to spell Gaston's name.
I think Josh Gad might have improvised a lot of those lines like that one. I know he did that when he played Olaf in Frozen.
Really? Well, he must be pretty creative then!
I also enjoy how the character of LeFou has been developed more from the animated version.
Yes, he doesn't seem quite so evil in this one, like he might actually have a conscience.
