What is one of the freakiest thriller movies you've ever watched lately?
I watched Split with my family. It was okay. Didn't know it was an M. Night Shyamalan movie until I was already in the movie!
Yeah M Night made a few good movies with a twist in my opinion.
This one reminds me of Sybil, who i think had multiple personalities also. Pretty much the same kinda split personalities genre with an M Knight flavor if you will.
I personally think James Mc Avoy was okay, but I told my wife when we watched the movie that I think Joaquin Phoenix would've been a better cast than James.
I thought so too and surprisingly he was actually considered first for the role before James but he was unavailable at that time.
I thought it was more of a mixture of thriller, and a bit of horror also.
Yeah, without giving too much spoiler, I guess you're right kinda a bit of a horror movie towards the end although not in a ghost kinda way.
True. I wonder if they have a sequel based on the last minute of the show.
We shall see. M Night's movie tend to have that open ending sometimes.
