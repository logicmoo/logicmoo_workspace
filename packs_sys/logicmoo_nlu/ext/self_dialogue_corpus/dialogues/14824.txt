One of my favorite comedies was this outrageous puppet movie called Team America : World Police. It was a scream.
Yes, I saw that one and loved it too. I remember watching the puppet TV shows decades ago - Thunderbirds, I lived for that one.
Team America was such a perfect copy of the marionettes in Thunderbirds, and at the same time, a total sendup that was fearless in its comedy.
I got a kick out of the goofiness of marionette movement and the lip moves and stuff - that was a constant funny throughout the whole thing.
Yes, and the sendup of the despot Kim Jong Il in his underwater lair like some Bond villain, was just falling down funny.
Totally. I remember him singing "I'm Lonely ("Wone-wee" in that hilariously awful Engrish) as one of his dispatched political victims floated in the water outside the window.
The tasteless stuff was the funniest stuff, honestly. Remember the puppet sex scene in the "unrated" version?
Funny enough that a puppet movie could be forced to cut certain scenes for sexual content, just let that sink in for a moment. But they were so funny, I can't imagine watching the tamer version
Yeah, if you're gonna go for it, jump in with both feet, right?
Thunderbirds must have been rolling in its grave, but Team America is a really funny movie.
