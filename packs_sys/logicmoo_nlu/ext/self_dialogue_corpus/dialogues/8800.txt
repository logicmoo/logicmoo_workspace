I heard my favorite music couple isn't going to be on The Voice tv show anymore. Gwen Stefani supposedly isn't returning, but Blake is.
They're still together though, aren't they?
Yeah, but I'll miss seeing them make cute faces at each other.
I don't know, I always thought they were a weird couple- she's an alternative rock star and he's a country star.
I know, her band No Doubt and her ex-husband Gavin Rossdale's band Bush were both alternative rock bands, so they seemed like a perfect couple.
It just seems like they would have had a lot more in common, her and Gavin both been rock stars, like they would have enjoyed listening to the same music.
It doesn't seem like she would have a lot in common with Blake, he's a country boy who likes hunting, and she's a California girl who loves make-up and clothes.
Well, you know what they say about opposites attract.
I think it was more a rebound affair after Gavin cheating. Not surprising he did, touring so much with women throwing themselves at him.
Maybe Gwen and Blake will give each other a new admiration of their respective music genres.
