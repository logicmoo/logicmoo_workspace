Has David Lynch done any horror movies?
That depends on how you define horror. Mostly his films are more weird than scary, though I think Fire Walk With Me was horrific.
What's that one about?
It is a prequel, and kind of a sequel, to the TV series he did with Mark Frost, Twin Peaks. It follows Laura Palmer up to when she was murdered.
I have not seen that show. Is it any good?
It is amazing! But not as dark as the movie. Sheryl Lee, the main actress, conveys fear and anguish so well in the film, compared to the quirkier show.
Do I need to see Twin Peaks before I watch Fire Walk With Me?
You probably should. Especially since there is a new season that has a lot of horror elements, that picks up 25 years after the movie.
What makes Fire Walk With Me scary?
There are these supernatural beings and bizarre happenings surrounding Laura Palmer, but nobody but her seems to know about it. She is just a teenager but she is being targeted by spirits from another world.
