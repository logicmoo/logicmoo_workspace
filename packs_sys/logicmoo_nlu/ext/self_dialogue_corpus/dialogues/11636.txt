Did you know that this year is the 50th anniversary of the Sgt Peppers album?
Yeah, I saw a special on PBS. It was a ground breaking album.
Rolling Stone magazine has consistently rated it as one of the top rock albums ever.
I know. "A Day in the Life" is one of the songs that always gets analyzed. The chord at the end lasts for something like 2 minutes.
Everybody covered "With a Little Help from My Friends". That was a great song.
Ringo did a great job singing that one. Joe Cocker covered that song at Woodstock in 1969.
George's song "Within You Without You" was the song that had a lot of Indian influence and made me finally appreciate the sitar.
Agreed! That was one of George's best songs. I thought McCartney's "Lovely Rita" was another great song on that album.
Oh yes! I love that song too. I like the ending where Lennon is making that sound as the song reaches a crescendo.
Man, the Beatles were the best group ever! There will never be another group like that!
