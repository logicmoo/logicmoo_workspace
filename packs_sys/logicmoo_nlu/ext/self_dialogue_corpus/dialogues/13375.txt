What do you think of Han Solo dying in the Force Awakens movie?
It really saddened me to no end. I mean, he was a true Star Wars icon. And that fact that his own son Kylo dealt the killing blow.
I really teared up on that scene especially because of Chewbacca. To lose his best friend that way.
That must have hurt the wookie a great deal. Then again, Leia seemed devastated.
Even though Carrie Fischer moved on to a better place, I do hope that the image of Leia continues to go on in the Last Jedi. After what happened to Han, I just can't bear to see Leia go as well.
If Leia does continue on though the movies, do you think her son Kylo will do something to her?
what do you mean 'do something' to her?
Like harm his mother in some way, or even kill her off like he did how father?
I would have to say no. I think that Kylo might have more of bond with his mother. And i believe she felt Kylos 'Goodness' through the force that linked them, this is how she knew he could be saved.
That could be true. But, he did kill his father. so how redeemable was he after all?
