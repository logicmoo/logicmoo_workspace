Have you  had a chance to see the last Guardians of the Galaxy movie?
Not yet.  Was it as good as the first one?
I thought it was great!
With that recommendation, I suppose I need to see it.  I heard it had some interesting surprises.
Yeah, including some actors not usually associated with Guardians.
Don't give it all away, but give me a teaser.  Who was in this one?
Sylvester Stallone put in a couple of appearances.  There were also some cameo shots with David Hasselhoff, and Kurt Russell played a key role.
Now those are a couple of classic actors! How was the music?
I thought it was good enough to purchase the soundtrack.  There was something for everyone if you like older music.
Really?  Do you happen to remember a couple of these?
Sure.  The movie opens with baby Groot dancing oblivious through a fight scene to ELO's "Mr. Blue Sky".  It was fantastic!
I heard baby Groot was one of the best characters in the movie.
He did play an important part throughout the movie.  Kurt Russell's character was something else too.
Was he a good guy or a bad guy?
Definitely a bit of a split personality.  That's all I will tell you about him - don't want to spoil the movie for you!
So was the music pretty much ELO style throughout?
No, it ranged from Glen Campbell to Cheap Trick.  Like I said, there was something for everyone.
Nice!  I heard that you really needed to stay for the closing credits.  Did you catch those?
I sure did!  You're gonna love teenage baby Groot!  The rest you will have to see for yourself.
Okay, you sold me on it.  It is on my to do list for this weekend!
