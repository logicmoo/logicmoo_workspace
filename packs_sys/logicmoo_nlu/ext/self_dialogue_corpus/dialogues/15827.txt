Have you heard Halestorm's latest single?
Yes they are amazing! My favorite is still "Here's to Us" though.
I know that's a great song, I love Lizzy Hale.
Lizzy is great. Did you know her brother is in the group too and when they first started their dad played bass?
I heard that, I know they are from Pennsylvania. What is their latest album?
It's called "Into the Wild Life."
They have a photo book released to called "To Hale and Back." If you are interested in Lizzy, it's got some great pictures and stories from her life .
I'll have to pick that up. Did you know they won a Grammy?
No I didn't. What category?
Best Hard Rock/Metal performance and they are the first group with a female vocalist to win.
Lizzy deserves it! I love it when I hear her voice come on when their songs play at the bar.
Ya they are great to dance too. "Here's to Us" is one of the best party songs ever.
"Freak Like Me" is a great dance song too.
Yes it is, I would love to see them live.
I want to see them live too. We should see where then they are touring and pick up tickets.
Let's make it a party, I bet we can find a bunch of people who want to see Halestorm.
They kind of sound like the old 80's rock bands but harder. There aren't very many rock or metal groups with a female lead like Lizzy.
Lizzy makes Halestorm. She has the most powerful voice and it's obvious she loves what she does.
Yes, that might be why they sound so amazing. Lizzy and Arejay are so passionate about their music.
I can't wait to see them live. Let's go find out when they are going to be close enough for us to see.
