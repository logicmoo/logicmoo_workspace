Man, Wonder Woman looks better than I was expecting.
I know, right? I guess that's what you get when you give it to an Israeli woman director.
I like how it's actually set in World War II, the way it should be.
I'm just... glad they're going for it. It would be so easy to mess this up, out of some assumption that young men don't want to watch a movie about a woman unless it's all T&A.
Yeah! You know, it's... I didn't see any obvious... "look at my ass" in the trailer.
No, I mean. It looks like they're taking this seriously, taking her seriously as a character.
They should! She's, like, the third most important character DC has and they're always ignoring her.
There was Lynda Carter, but even then they chickened out after a couple of seasons. Brought it into the glamorous 1970s.
That's what I was talking about. Looks like they're going for it, and tossing her into the time period where she actually makes sense.
Yeah. Though... that makes me wonder how they plan to resolve this with the rest of the DC cinematic universe... not that I care about anything else they're doing.
