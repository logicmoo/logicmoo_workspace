Hey, you know I've been wanting to learn how to play guitar lately.
At this stage of your life?
Yeah. I've been hearing this kid that my daughter listens to lately called Ed Sheeran.
And what? You like it?
Yeah, he sound great. But what I like is how simple every song is.
Well, it is simple for him since he is a musician.
No, but I mean that this kid gets up on stage by himself just using a guitar and entertains crowds.
Honestly, I think you are a bit to old for this.
You're not getting the point. I want to make music in a simple way too, like I've always wanted.
Oh, ok. So you want to become a pop star on your own.
Ha! That's going a bit too far.
What is it then?
Just jam and express my self. I mean, it can't be that hard.
Well, you'll need at least a year of practice first. Do you have the time?
I'll make the time. And then we can sing some songs together.
Kareoke style, and impress our wives!
That's what I'm talking about.
I think I'll learn some bongo to accompany you.
That Ed Sheeran kid will copy us and start bringing a bongo man to the stage with him.
I have no doubt about that.
