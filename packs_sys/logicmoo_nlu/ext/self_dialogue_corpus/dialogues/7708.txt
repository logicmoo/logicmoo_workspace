who was your favorite character in the harry potter films?
Hagrid, he was always so loveable.
I did enjoy him as well. The gentle giant as they say.
He always was true to Harry and he had cool animals.  what about you?
It may be bland but I always liked Harry Potter best. Than maybe gobbe.
Harry mayb be obvious but a great character. I like ron but wish Harry ended up with herimone instead.
Ya I felt the romance between Ron and Hermione was off and awkward to watch on screen.
Agreed. I know J.K. wanted to do something not so typical but this felt forced, not authentic.
Maybe in the books it was a clearer attraction or better presented. But I never read the books only watched the films.
Same for me. i have heard the books are really great. i felt a little old to start them at the time and then after you see the movies hard to read the book version.
