What kind of music do you like?
I'm a big fan of classic rock, how about you?
I love rock and roll music too. The classics are definitely great, that's what I grew up listening to.
Same here. The Beatles are probably my favorite band of all time.
Oh yeah, for sure, The Beatles are legendary. What's your favorite album of theirs?
That's a tough call, but I would probably have to say Rubber Soul. What about you?
The White Album for me, I love the way that they experimented with totally new ideas.
Yeah, it was definitely a game changer. "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" is one of my top Beatles tunes.
Agreed, one of George Harrison's finest. He went on to do some great solo work as well.
He sure did, going solo really gave him a chance to shine and show what he was capable of.
Yeah, Lennon and McCartney really exerted a lot of control on the songs, which I get, but it was great to hear all the songs George had amassed over the years.
Yes, I really loved the fact that he was more in tune with his spiritual side. His work was really special.
I agree. What other bands are you into?
Led Zeppelin was another big one for me.
Oh, for sure, you'd be hard put to find a better guitarist than Jimmy Page.
His guitar work was legendary! The musicianship across the board really was stellar.
That's true, so many great songs that will live on in history.
Definitely. I really love the way that they incorporated mythology into many of their songs as well.
Yes, there was definitely a mysticism about the band. I always really loved their heavier stuff.
They really were epic in every sense of the word.
