You know who I miss and what's missing from football these days?
Um...what about actual play without all the mamby-pamby rules?
No, that's not what I mean. I miss the immediate sense of the game and the innovation.
Dude, that's why I watch college football.
I know, remember when Tebow was playing in the NFL?
I remember he was bad at it.
No, not at all! Well, yes he was, but a Tebow football game was exciting!
I'll give you that, but it was all the team around him making up for bad play.
It's always the team dude, Peyton Manning in his last superbowl had a rating of 27, it was the team then too.
I suppose i can give you that, but why Tebow?
I always compared Tebow and Manning, Tebow was organic and exciting, Manning was cool and collected.
It you're gonna say Tebow was better than Manning....I'm out of here
THat's not it at all, I'm saying Tebow was more exciting to watch even though Manning is a better QB
How so?
Well, like in that playoff game against the Steelers, Tebow was unpredictable, he could move as an RB and still had a QB threat.
So could a lot of run-option Qbs
I know, but they have to skitter to the side, his build meant he might go up the middle, that you needed to blitz to take him down, and he was fast and slippery
I did like to see the QB play the game with the rest.
So I'm just saying, Tebow was exciting and I miss that in a lot of games.
I get what you're saying.
