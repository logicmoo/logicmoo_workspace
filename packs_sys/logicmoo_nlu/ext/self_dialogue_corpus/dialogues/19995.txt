What type of music do you enjoy the most?
Oh, I listen to a variety but my favorite is old gospel hymns.
Where do you find that type of music?
A few Christian radio stations play them in between the more modern Christian songs.  I have CDs of my favorite artists.
Which ones would be those favorites?
Steven Curtis Chapman, Chris Tomlin, Kim Hill are three of the best ones for my ears.
Who do you listen to for the Gospel music?
Oh, I love listening to the Bil Gaither and the folks he gathers around to sing so many great pieces.
Have you ever watched any of their videos?
Many, many!  Each person there can sing and resonate the beauty of God's Word.
You mentioned you listen to a variety of music.  What other genres?
Well, I also love classical music since I soent my high school years playing the clarient and bassoon in the concert band/orchestra.
Do have any favorite composers?
Yes, I really like Vivaldi, Hayden, Shostakovich, to name only a few.
Are there any pieces that you like better than others?
I really love Vivaldi's "Four Seasons."  Each season has its own uniqueness, making them each a delight to listen to.
And Shostakovich's music?  I do not know him.
Shostakovich was a Russian composer.  The "Symphony No. 5" is the best for me as the finale is filled with tympani, reverberating with Russian feelings.
Wow!  You really have a wide choice of music from which to listen.
And I did not even add how I love the Rock 'n Roll of the 1960s and 70s.
