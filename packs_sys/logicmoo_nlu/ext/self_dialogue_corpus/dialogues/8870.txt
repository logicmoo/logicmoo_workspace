Do you want to come over tonight? We could watch a dvd and order a pizza.
What movie do you want to watch?
I rented a couple movies this morning. I have one called The Runaways. It has Kristen Stewart in it, and it's about the 70s girl rock band.
Oh yeah, I like that movie. I always liked Joan Jett, she had a really powerful voice. I used to have that album with the song Cherry Bomb.
They were one of the beginning girl bands that really rocked. I like the movie because it tells what life was really like for them.
It must have been hard being girls and being rockers back in the 70s when it was mostly guys.
Yeah, life was a lot different back then, especially for women.
She's still making music, she put out  a song in 2013 she wrote with Dave Grohl from Nirvana and Foo FIghters.
That's kind of weird to think of isn't it? A 70s rocker and a Nirvana band member writing together in 2013.
It just goes to show how they are both still such good musicians.
