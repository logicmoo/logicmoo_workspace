The first NFL preseason game is going to be in less than a month!
Wow, I can't believe it's that time of year again.
It seems just a few weeks ago that the Falcons lost to the Patriots in that epic comeback.
I think both teams will do well this season. Pretty much all of the players from last year are intact.
Matt Ryan will be a man on a mission this year...if he's healthy.
The Cowboys should get far too. Prescott will be more mature and just as athletic as last year.
Yeah, the Cowboys should win the NFC East without a doubt.
I think some other teams that were good the past few years will be going downhill though....The Packers and the Saints won't make the playoffs.
Yeah, both Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees are getting old.
I am looking forward to what Derek Carr is going to do in Oakland. If he didn't get injured late in the season, they could have gone deep into the playoffs last year.
Yeah, the AFC is going to be pretty competitve, with 5 mediocre teams battling it out.
Who do you think will make it to the SuperBowl this year?
I think both the Patriots and the Falcons can return to the Super Bowl again, although Patriots and Cowboys is also probable.
Patriots and Cowboys would be a really good game to watch.  All of the good teams are heavily dependent on their quarterbacks being healthy, though.
Tom Brady always has a great offensive line protecting him. That's why he's still able to play so well. He's going to be 40 this year!
Yikes. He's one sack and one bad injury away from retirement then.
A lot of teams have no hope from the beginning this season, because they don't have a quarterback!
Yeah, Cleveland again, and the Jets!  Both of these teams will be lucky if they win 5 games the entire season.
It's surprising no one signed Colin Kapernick.
Well, he has major image issues outside his playing ability. I don't think teams would want to deal with that when they are having a losing record.
