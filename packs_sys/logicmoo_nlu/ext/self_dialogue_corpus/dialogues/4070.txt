I think one thriller that is slightly underrated is The Butterfly Effect with Ashton Kutcher from 2004. Have you seen it?
I have not seen that, honestly. Ashton Kutcher doing a thriller movie, really?
I was caught off guard by it, as well. But when I saw it for the first time back then, I thought it was pretty good.
Does it still hold up after all of these years, including Kutcher's performance?
I still think the movie is fine if you take out the college rock music from that time period.
What's the film about exactly?
A young college kid played by Kutcher, discovers he is able to travel through time and does so in attempt to make life better for he and his friends.
That doesn't sound like too bad of a plot. Is it really Sci-Fi like?
Actually, no. While it is a thriller, there is also some decent drama in it.
I am definitely interested in this movie and may just check it out sometime.
