Have you ever been to the Hollywood Bowl for a music concert?
A couple times. Cool venue.
I grew up going to the Bowl for the annual July 4th extravaganza with the fireworks.
That must have been a fun tradition.
I had three siblings, and there's not many places a family of six can go for good inexpensive entertainment.
I'm guessing you didn't get food at the Bowl, then. The prices!
No, we brought boxed Kentucky Fried Chicken dinners.
I guess that was another family tradition, along with the Bowl.
This is why I love KFC to this day. Those are great memories.
How did your evenings go?
We always sat in the nosebleed seats way in the back, because they were the cheapest,
That inexpensive family entertainment you mentioned before.
Of course. But when you go for the view and the music, those are actually the best seats in the house.
I remember from my trips to the Bowl that it was an amazing view of the entire valley the Bowl is located in.
And as soon as night falls, it feels like you're in another world, just you and the crowd and the music.
What kind of music did you listen to?
It was usually standards, classical pieces and the like. I learned about a lot of classical music from my nights at the Bowl.
And you said there were fireworks at the end?
Yes, accompanied by the 1812 Overture. It was a perfect ending to a great evening.
They still do the July 4th shows at the Bowl. I'll have to go to one someday.
