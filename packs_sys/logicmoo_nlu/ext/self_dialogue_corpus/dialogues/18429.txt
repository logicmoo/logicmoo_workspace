What are you listening to right now? I'm so interested.
You're not going to believe me. I'm listening to Johnny Mathis Greatest Hits.
You're right, I don't believe you. Johnny Mathis peaked before you were born, no?
I love good music. It doesn't matter what time it was popular.
He's an amazing singer of course. He just lets out Christmas albums now.
He has such a legacy. He doesn't need a new hit.
Every artist needs to connect and reconnect with his fans. He might make new ones.
Well I believe when you make good music you don't have to do more. He has a massive catalog.
What is your favorite Johnny Mathis song? Let me guess. White Christmas.
Not exactly. My favorite is a tie between "It's Not For Me To Say" and "Chances Are".
My mother always played Johnny Mathis. He does have a suave voice.
He's a master of control. They must have done lots of yoga.
You're funny. There were more expectations for singers. You can't just give people anything.
Songwriting was so innocent still. They would be appalled by the lyrics of today's crooners.
I'm still amazed you are listening now. Is there a reason you're listening to Johnny now?
I feel like hearing clean and controlled voices. Pain in the voice is for nowadays.
Well that's great. I do like gut wrenching singing. It makes me feel alive.
I understand, However this kind of pronunciation that those singers
I love Nat King Cole. These guys were of a different caliber of the singers today.
Exactly. I'm about to listen to Nat King Cole too. He's amazing.
