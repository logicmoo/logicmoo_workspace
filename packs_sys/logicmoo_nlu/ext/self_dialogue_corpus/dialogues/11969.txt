Did anyone really think Luke was a little short to be a stormtrooper?
Yeah... I know!  No, he could have decently passed for a storm trooper!
In fact, he had!  Or so I thought.  He was traipsing around the Death Star with Han Solo in storm trooper gear for a while before they managed to make it--basically un-harrassed--to the detention level.  So I would say he DIDN'T draw attention to himself for being short.
Maybe the purpose of that line Princess Leia used, "Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?" was in there to draw attention to, or further emphasize, the fact that Luke was basically still a teenager...a kid.  Lots of references to this throughout the film.  For example, Han Solo regularly refers to Luke as "kid..."
You're probably right.  I just can't help but think Leia's line there could have been so much more dramatic--even humorous...
Well, the banter between Obi Wan Kenobi, too, could have used some serious tinkering, too
I guess, overall, at the end of the day--while the original Star Wars trilogy had it's "meh" dialogue moments and lackluster acting-- it STILL, by far, outshines the later prequels George Lucas decided to crank out
Still nauseated at the over-complicated, boring, political plots and sub-plots that just made most Star Wars' fans miserable...the original trilogy had light-saber-induced limb amputations and surprise familial twists, etc.  The prequels had...what..votes of no confidence in the freakin' senate, and toddler-Vader pod racing and yee-hawing in the desert?  It...there just is no....I mean...is NOTHING sacred?
Jar Jar action figures and lunch boxes...the HUMANITY!!
I know!  Let's hope that DIsney makes it stop....please no more Star Wars abominations and atrocities...!!
