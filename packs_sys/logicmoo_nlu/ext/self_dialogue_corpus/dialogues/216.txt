Read any good comic books lately?
Personally, I'm not a fan of comics. Takes too long to get engrossed in the story, I prefer to watch superhero movies.
Dude, you don't know what you're missing out on! There's so much stuff they miss out on in the movies.
I get what you mean, but I think reading comic books is a little juvenile. It's more normal to go see a superhero movie instead.
Juvenile? You're crazy man, some of the best superhero story arcs haven't even been covered in the movies!
Well, I'd rather watch a two hour Batman movie as opposed to spending hours reading comics and catching up on many years worth of story.
You don't know what you're missing out on man, the movies are never as good as the comics. Look at the Daredevil movie with Ben Affleck, it was terrible.
Yeah, I agree with you on that, but the show on Netflix is way better.
Well, I agree with you too! But honestly, give comic books a chance!
Maybe if I had more free time, but for now, I'll stick to watching superheroes on the big screen.
