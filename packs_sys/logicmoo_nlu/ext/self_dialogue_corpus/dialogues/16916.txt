The first ever song I composed was called "Goin' Back to Phoenix" in the 80's.
Oh really, you mean like "Goin' Back to Cali"?
Yep, I must have been in the 5th grade. My friend Franklin and I did this thing.
Yeah, but who'd want to go to Phoenix?
Exactly, the line was something like, "Goin back to Phoenix, Phoenix Phoenix, goin' back to Phoenix, nah it's too hot there.."
Ha ha, yeah. Did you use a 4 track?
Nope, we just had a keyboard with a 5 piece drum kit and simple bass line. We did it all in real time.
Do you still have it, the song?
No way, but we took it to school and let the girls listen to it. We became more popular because of it.
This was the 5th grade?
It was 5th or 6th and we became the 2 white rappers of Tomahawk Elementary.
That's cool, so did you do anything else, composition wise?
Later in my 20's I wrote some score stuff for my "On the Lot" submission.
"On the Lot"?
Spielberg and Mark Burnett got together and did this competition reality show for original video submissions.
I must have missed it.
I did a Sci Fi alien thing and composed the music for it using Cubase.
Really, it was 50's 60s sci fi flying saucer stuff, or like what?
No, I was trying to copy John Williams style.
Excellent! Jaws on Sci Fi!
