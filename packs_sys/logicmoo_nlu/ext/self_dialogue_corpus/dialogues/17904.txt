So what is new in the music world for you?
Well I just got the new album by Lady Gaga named Joanne.
Oh yeah how did you like it? Where all the songs on the album good or was it hit and miss.
It was consistantly good and I like how she took a bit of a folk Americana aspect to many of the songs.
Nice I have yet to sit down an listen to it but I herd that the new Katty Perry album was shit.
Oh I herd that too, it was just weak and many of the songs not ever worth the time.
That is wild to think because how popular she was in the past with her many EPs and top 40 hits.
Yea like her song Lion, I really liked that song but just feel like she doesn't have the popularity she had in 2010
Do you know of the indie rock band Thao & The Get Down Stay Down?
No I have no idea who that is. Tell me about them.
They are a band from San Francisco and released there debut album in 2008 with their most recent album being release in 2013.
So they aren't that current, What sort of music do they perform?
They are very much the typical indie rock group with Thao Ngyen as the lead vocalist and guitarist.
Sounds like a band I could very well enjoy. What is your favorite album?
Well I would have to say the one released in 2008 under the name of We Brave Bee Stings and All.
What an interesting title to an album. Where do they come up with these things.
I don't know, may that is the creative side of art, duh.
When was the last time you went to a live show?
I think it was the super indie show in a coffee show in San Francisco a few years back. What about you?
Well I had gone to the Bluegrass Music Festival a few weeks ago.
