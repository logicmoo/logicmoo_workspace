I'm so glad I grew up listening to ska.
Me too, I can't imagine life without it.
You know that's what made me interested in horns in high school.
No kidding?
Yeah, it was all because of ska. Before that I thought horns were boring and only in Jazz and other lame music.
But you know better now.
Now I know, and I think it's helping make horns more popular.
For me personally, it's inspiring seeing other females in ska bands, like One Eighty, Save Ferris, and Leanor Ortega in Five Iron.
I think that's definitely important and I love that females are finding places in ska.
I think that's one of the things that makes ska stronger.
You know ska has always been a pioneer against racism and homophobia, even having whole tours called things like "ska against racism"
I love that and that's one of the things that makes me proud to identify with the genre.
Well you know it has roots in integration and inclusiveness.
That would make sense why that's prevalent in a lot of the lyrics even today.
Yeah I love how that's something that has stood the test of time throughout that music scene.
It's one of the things that got me interested in it in the first place.
Yeah that's important. I like 2 tone ska for that reason.
Why is it called 2 tone again?
It came from the record label name of the guy who led it and its mission to ease racial tensions at the time.
Very cool.
