So, this gay Babadook meme has me thinking of the film again. Did you see it?
Yes. I loved the art with the book illustrations but the scares were somewhat standard fare for horror. The meme is fabulous, though.
I get what you mean about the  scares but that ending though…
Oh yes, the ending was brilliant. The big bad isn't banished, merely made manageable. Good twist.
I read in some interviews that it was a metaphor for grief and/or childhood mental illness.
Yeah, I can see that. That's a new one. Almost like how Insidious had a haunted child as opposed to a haunted place.
Yes, except this movie didn't suck the life out of me with boring actors like Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne.
Oh my glob, I know right? They're like watching cardboard. Totally took me out of the atmosphere of the tilm. I just wanted them to die.
Wanting the protagonists to die is a bad thing for horror… like normally you want to root for them.
Yes, you want your Final Girl to triumph. Not the ill-defined underworld Darth Maul Tiny Tim … thing.
