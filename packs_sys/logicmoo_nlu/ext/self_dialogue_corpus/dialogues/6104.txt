I was able to get my daughter the snow white and the seven dwarves movie and she loved it
I also am a big fan of that movie
The names that they gpcame up with the seven dwarfs was so funny
Yeah I believe they were sleep dopey bashful sneezy happy grumpy and doc
The concept behind the poisoned Apple was a little creepy
I think she was really crazy
Snow white was such a loving character in that movie
You had to fall in love with her when she met the dwarfs
The end was a tell tale romance
Yeah she got kidpssed by The Prince from her slumber and woke up
