Wow Joe i was shocked we lost the game was so close it was almost unreal how close it was.
I know he narrowly made  those free shots.
If only he had made them the team would have won the game
Yeah he was like hitting the rim and they bounced off.
It was like cosmic magic or something did not want them to win
My thoughts exactly i was like sad.
I was sad too but you know what was good about it?
It was a close game like none i have seen recently.
Games so much lately have been boring
Most of the time yeah they are not interesting.
I find them to be rather on sided and it just bores me to tears
I know the other team has to put up a fight and score
Otherwise it just ends up one team scoring and just no impact you get what i mean
I get exactly what you mean it is horrible
Like i want to feel tense i want to be on the edge of my seat
Yeah that is the best feeling
Especially when you are in the crowd
Exactly! it is like a new life or something
I hope the next game turns out like this one did.
Me too it is rather fun when it is close.
