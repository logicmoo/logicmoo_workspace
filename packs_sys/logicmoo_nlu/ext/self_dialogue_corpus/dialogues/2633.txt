I don't think much of today's NFL players. They don't really have the skills and passions of the older guys.
Yeah, I know what you mean. All my favorite players retired at least 20 years ago.
Who are some of your favorites?
I have quite a few actually. To begin with, there's Fran Tarkenton.
Scramblin' Fran Tarkenton. I remember him; he was great.
He was one of the best ever, but somehow he always seemed to lose the big game.
He just didn't have the players to support him, I think.
You're probably right. Of course, there are other great players like Eric Dickerson.
I remember watching Dickerson in high school. My team played his Sealy team in the state playoffs.
What happened? Dickerson ran all over my team, just like he did to every defense in the NFL.
No kidding. Him and Larry Csonka and Rocky Bleier. Those guys just couldn't be stopped.
Don't forget Jim Brown. He was probably the most unstoppable of all.
What about defensive players? Did you have any old-time favorites?
Oh, I have plenty. Deacon Jones, Ed 'Too Tall' Jones, 'Mean' Joe Greene, and the rest of them.
I forgot about 'Mean' Joe Greene and his Coke commercial. That was classic.
Yeah, all those old guys made some great commercials. Of course, Peyton Manning makes great commercials nowadays.
He does, but Peyton Manning is the exception. His commercials are always fun, but nobody else does such good commercials.
I guess you're right about that. So how about kickers?
Kickers are easy. No one beats George Blanda and Morten Andersen.
I suppose you're right about that. They were the best, probably of all time.
