Hey, what's up?  You won't believe what movie we watched last night.
What was it?
Harry Potter!  I finally jumped on the bandwagon.
Oh wow, I can't believe you've never seen that movie!  Which one, the first one?
Yes, we watched the Sorcerer's Stone but it was so good we started the next one right after it.
Yeah, they are truly great.  It's neat how similar they are to the books.
I know!  That's why we wanted to see them, was to see if it was how we visualized it.
Who'd you watch it with, your family?
Yes, we all watched it together.
Awesome.  I think the only disappointing thing is how much is left out of the plots.
Yeah but there's so much there's no way they could include everything.
I know, I know.  But I still would've liked to see a lot that wasn't there.
Yeah, I know what you mean.  Did you think Harry and Hermione were well cast?
Yeah, Hermione didn't look quite like I imagined her but Harry was dead on.
Yeah, I thought Hermione was dead on too.  And Professor Snape was exactly how I pictured him!
Oh not me!  But Dumbledore was exactly as I imagined.
Well overall they really did a good job casting the characters.
Yeah, I think so.  It must've cost a fortune to produce.
I bet, with all the complicated scenery.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  Well it sure generated enough revenue to make a profit, though!
