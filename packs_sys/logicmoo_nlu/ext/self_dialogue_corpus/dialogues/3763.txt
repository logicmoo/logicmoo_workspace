When was the last time you went to see a good Thriller movie? I went last week to see hush have you ever seen it?
No i haven't what was the movie about? Was it a good one? and scary.
You know it had to be a good one or else i wouldn't be telling you about the movie. It's from 2016 just last year.
Okay i want to know what happened and i may go check it out later myself.
Well It is starring the Actors Mike Flanagan and Kate Siegel. It starts with this deaf woman she has a friend and lives out in the middle of no where.
Wow keep going this sounds pretty interesting. go on I think i am going to be really scared i can tell by the way you look and sound.
So her friend comes over for diner but the food burns up so she leaves and goes home she came back and someone had killed her.
Killed her how can I guess? The idiot followed the girl then murders her and now wants to murder her girl-friend.
something like that yes but he get's the friend's boyfriend first then keeps trying to get inside the house to finish her off. She puts up a big fight all through the rest of the movie.
Let me guess again he kills her too. Or no don't tell me i'm going to order the movie so i can see it for my self. great Thriller Thanks.
