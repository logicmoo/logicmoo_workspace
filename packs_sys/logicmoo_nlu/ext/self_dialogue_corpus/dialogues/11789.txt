Hey, Shirley, what do you think of the Beatles?
They were great!  Just love their music.
Me too and they are also very handsome!
Yes - especially John and Paul!
I Love You Yeah, Yeah!  One of their best!
They had so many hits.  We loved dancing to their songs.
We did too - did you ever go to the teen club at the church?
I sure did - every Saturday night we danced to the Beatles!
I was there every Saturday too - I loved dancing with Tim to their songs.
I still enjoy listening to their music - "Hey Jude" was another favorites of mine.  Awesome song.
