Did you see the basketball game last night?
Yes, and I couldn't believe how bad the calls were.
It seemed like the refs were oblivious when a player deliberately elbowed someone.
I don't think those refs would have noticed if one team had 7 players on the court and the other team had 3 players.
You're probably right.
I hate poorly refereed games. It takes the emphasis off of two teams trying to prove who is better, it's just which team gets luckier with the ref's calls.
Have you ever seen murderball?
What the heck is muderball?
Disabled athletes who are confined to wheelchairs play against each other. Some have other disabilities, too. The games are absolutely amazing.
How can they play basketball with wheelchairs out on the court?
They're special wheelchiars, designed to go faster and turn sharper. Those athletes aren't just playing basketball like regular teams, they're pushing their wheelchairs as fast as they can go the whole time.
You must get some serious upper body workout from that.
Exactly. I love watching those games because the dedication and athleticism of the players is so awesome. It really is inspiring.
Last night's game had fouls, Do murderball games have fouls?
They have brutal fouls. If somebody gets thrown an elbow when the ref isn't looking, it can even knock the player's chair over on the court and knock the player to the floor.
Sounds like murderball is more punishing on athletes than ordinary basketball.
It's gaining in popularity and has become an Olympic sport because the games are so exciting. They're addictive.
Do they have women's teams too?
Of course! Just like there are women basketball teams, there are women murderball teams. They don't get any breaks because they're women, they train and play just as hard as the women.
You've got me really interested in finding out more about this. I want to see a game!
