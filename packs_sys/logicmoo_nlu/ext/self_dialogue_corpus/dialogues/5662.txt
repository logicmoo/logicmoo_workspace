I watched The Lion King with the grandchildren the other night and I cried like a baby.
I know when his father died it was so sad. My husband said he cried when he saw Old Yeller
Oh my that is an old one. That was made in the late 1950's and it stars Tommy Kirk, Dorothy McGuire and Beverly Washburn.
How do you remember that?
I have watched it twenty times we have it on tape.
Do you have Aladdin? I would like to watch that one again.
Yes, I will loan it to you. It will make you miss Robin Williams.
I forgot he was the genie. My grandchildren would really enjoy watching it.
Better watch out they will be rubbing every vase in your house trying to rub out the genie.
Sounds like a good way to get the knick knacks dusted.
