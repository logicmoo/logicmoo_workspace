Did you like the new Star Wars movie?
I don't know, I have not seen it.
Haven't seen it? It is like the most watched movie in forever. Why haven't you seen it?
I am not really interested in new movies. They always try to explain things that should be left to the imagination.
I don't understand, can you explain?
Well I think that the Phantom Menace was a waste of a movie since they used the whole build up of the movie over explained Darth Vader so it took away all imaginations for him.
I liked the Phantom Menace, I thought it was a good story line.
Story line yes but it changed the whole dynamic of the movies for me.
Change the dynamic how?
It began to explain Darth Vader and at the end I actually felt a little pity for him. Prior to that Darth Vader was a true villain. One should not have any sympathy for a villain.
