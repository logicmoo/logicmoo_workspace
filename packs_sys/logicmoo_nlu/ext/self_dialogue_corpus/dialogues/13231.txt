Imagine what it would like in the Star Wars universe. What if you're a regular guy who just finds a light saber on the ground.
With how often the Jedi lose them, it probably happens a lot.
The guy probably hang it on his wall at home.
He tells the girls he brings home, "Yeah. i killed a jedi and took his saber."
He'd probably end up lopping off an arm at some point.
His? Or someone else's?
Depends on how drunk he is, I'd imagine.
How do you explain that to the doctor?
"Dang jedi just walked up and took my arm off!"
They're all robot doctors. I don't know if they'd buy that.
