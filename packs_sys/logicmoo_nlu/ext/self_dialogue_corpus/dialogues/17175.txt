My favorite hip hop album of all time is Illmatic by Nas. What about you?
Illmatic is at the top of my list too, bit there are a few others as close competition. Criminal Minded by Boogie Down Productions, for example.
Oh, yeah. That's a good one. So lo-tech and gritty. And it introduced KRS-ONE to the world.
And let's not forget the production of Scott LaRock. There's really no album that has the same sound as Criminal Minded.
And of course it's also got one of the greatest diss track of All Time. "The Bridge Is Over."
And "South Bronx" too! Two diss tracks. Poor MC Shan.
I always though that KRS-ONE's later albums suffered a lot from the loss of Scott La Rock.
Yeah, the production was just never quite there. He had it as an MC, but his beats were a bit lacking except for the occasional classic like "Love's Gonna Get Ya."
Agreed. It wasn't until Return of the Boom Bap with DJ Premier that I think he really had another totally solid album.
And DJ Premier did some of the best beats on Illmatic! It all comes full circle.
Have you heard the story about the vocal track for "NY State of Mind" on Illmatic?
Yeah, that the first verse is Nas's first take. Crazy.
He even says, "I don't know how to start this..." right before he goes into his first verse and kills it.
Have you ever listened to the demo for Illmatic? Pretty interesting listen.
Yeah, you can really see how the Large Professor's mentorship helped Nas.
Definitely. He helped him craft his lyrics. Taught him how to edit and to never be satisfied until the lyrics were 100% there.
And I think that's a big reason Nas is one of the all time great MCs.
He has always put so much time and effort into his lyrics, unlike some of these wack MCs on the radio today.
And don't forget Large Professor's production contributions too. He had some of the hottest beats on Illmatic.
For sure. Using "Human Nature" as the basis for "Aint' Hard to Tell" was genius.
