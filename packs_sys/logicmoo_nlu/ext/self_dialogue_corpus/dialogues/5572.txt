I was watching Cars the other night, my favorite is still Sally.
I'm more partial to Doc. That scene where he puts on his old race tires and is my favorite.
That's when Lightening realizes that he was in the presence of greatness.
It was. The colors in that part of the film were amazing, and the blue on Doc, well...it reminded me so much of Paul Newman's eyes.
I just loved seeing Doc on the stand, at the race.
My favorite part in that scene was when Mator finally said goodbye.
Red, Lizzy and Sally gathered around that old black and white tv was adorable. I think they stayed behind for Lizzie.
I do too. She is a great character, I liked when she slapped that bumper sticker on Lightening.
Me too! And, when she said goodnight to Stanley.
That was sad and sweet at the same time.
