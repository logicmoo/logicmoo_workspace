I finally watched The Lion King with my kids.
Oh that's a great movie to watch with kids. I loved the music.
Ya they really liked I just can't wait to be kind. Isaac asked to hear it again after the movie.
I still like Simba and Nala singing Can you Feel the love tonight.
Ya, that's a part I liked more as i'm older but I don't think they liked it.
They also thought Timon and Pumba were funny. Isaac laughed when they were first there scaring away the voltures.
I remember as a kid really liked the part where Simba fights Scar.
Oh ya that's good too. Isaac kept calling him Scarf. I thought that was funny.
Cute! I actually have the CD would they want to borrow that?
I bet they would love to hear all the songs again.
