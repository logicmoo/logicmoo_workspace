Who's would you choose, Neve Campbell or Jamie Lee Curtis for all time best scream queen?
I think I will have to stick with the classic legendary, Jamie Lee Curtis. She was a pioneer and paved the path for Neve Campbell, her performance in the original John Carpenter's Halloween is still one of the all time best.
Jamie Lee Curtis also gets my vote, although Neve really revived the term scream queen for her performance in the original Scream and the subsequent Screams that followed it.
Oh don't get me wrong, Neve was superb as Sidney Prescott in the Scream series, I'm just a little biased towards Jamie Lee Curtis.
Jamie Lee was the definitive scream queen of the 80's. Prom Night, Terror Train, the Halloween Series, The Fog, there's so many and she just has so much charisma on screen playing these types of roles.
I'm trying to think of some modern scream queens, and the only name that comes to mind for me of late is Mary Elizabeth Winstead for all the movies she's done so far in horror.
She's definitely my favorite right now! I think she needs to do more because she's so good in horror roles. Final Destination 3, The Thing, 10 Cloverfield Lane, Black Christmas, she just plays the character so well!
Those are some nostalgic movies. She really shined in Final Destination 3 and The Thing. I thought the Black Christmas remake was a mess and I was probably disappointed Mary Elizabeth Winstead didn't get a bigger role.
I heard she took the role unwillingly and said she would do it if her character was killed off?
I think you have her mixed up with Michelle Trachtenberg, who said she would be in the movie only if her character was killed off because she wouldn't return for any sequels.
