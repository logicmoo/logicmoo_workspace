I think the Chargers are going to win the west this year.
No way, the Raiders are by far the better team. I think they will win it all.
The Chargers are healthy and Bosa going into his second year is going to be a beast on defense.
I don't think the Chargers can stay healthy though. Look at the Raiders with Carr at QB they are just too good.
They aren't going to look that good when Bosa sacks Carr at least twice both games.
You're crazy! Also, the Chargers just moved to that tiny stadium in LA and most of their fan base jumped ship.
I think they will do better in a smaller place and those guys are hungry for a championship. They will have more than enough fans in LA trust me.
The Chargers have been hungry and they always choke.
I'm telling you, this is their year. Rivers finally has some protection from the line and great true receivers to throw to.
I think Rivers deserves a super bowl ring I just don't think the Chargers are going to get him one.
We'll see where they're at mid-season, I really think you're going to be surprised. Rivers is going to get what he's worked so hard for.
They aren't going to beat the Raiders though, they are just too tough. Look at that defense from last year they were beasts.
I think the Raiders are overrated and its going to show this year.
Overrated? Youu must be joking. Did you see we signed Lynch in the off-season. Beastmode!
He's old and should have retired. Hope he enjoys getting planted by Bosa and crew every game.
You'll see Lynch is going to put up huge numbers and run all over everybody.
I don't see it happening, not in this division. I think you're going to see Gordon put up bigger numbers.
Gordon got lucky last season. Do you not remember his rookie year?
Oh, I remember. He was awesome last year and he's only going to get better.
I guess we'll just have to wait and see then.
