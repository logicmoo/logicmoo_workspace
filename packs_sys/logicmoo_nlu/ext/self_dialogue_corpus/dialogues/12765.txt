Are you looking forward to Han Solo: A Star Wars Story next year?
I'm so excited about it! They just announced Ron Howard will direct it!
I'm looking forward to seeing how Alden Ehrenreich will do as Han! Emilia Clarke is also going to be in there along with Woody Harrelson and Donny Glover although their characters haven't been revealed yet!
Alden's really good! I saw him in Hail, Caeser with George Clooney and he's really talented. I can't wait to see what he does as Han Solo!
I'm really interested to see what direction they take this. I'm not sure where I understand the timeline.
I think I recall that it's going to be set before he gets frozen in the carbonite.
So that's probably setting place in the time before he meets Jabba the Hut.
I believe so! But you know, they always change things up. So for now that's what I'm going with.
We'll have Chewbacca! You also know the Millennium Falcon will be there! So, I'll be excited for all of this!
We have to wait until next May the 25th of 2018 for it, but it should come around quick!
