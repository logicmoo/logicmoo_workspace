Have you see Land of the Dead?
Yeah, I liked it but it was a clear step back from the first 3 movies in the Dead series.
I know what you mean.  The acting was a little off for one.
And zombies learning to think another.  At least one of them did.
I did like how they set up cities across the world.  Shows that we will find a way.
I also liked when John Leglazarro came after Dennis Hopper's character.
When he was a zombie.  That was great, revenge at it's best.
There was also that gross scene that was like a throw back to Dawn of the Dead.
When the zombies were basically chowing down.
A pretty good zombie bite when that one still had a spinal cord too.
