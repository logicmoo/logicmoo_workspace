So, what horror films do you want to see?
Well, gosh there's several that have been out for awhile i want to watch but haven't gotten around to. For examples, Train to Busan/
I don't think I've heard of that one.
Yeah, it's from South Korea.  It's about this guy and his young daughter who get onboard a bullet and it starts getting taken over by zombies.  i heard it's got a lot of action and is real suspenseful.
Whoa, that sounds pretty cool.
Yeah, another one I want to see is The Girl With All the Gift.
I'm sensing a theme here...
Haha.. yeah, they both have to do with zombies... although I don't think they're called that in The Girl.
Yeah, I've heard people praising that film as really good.
I may have to read the book it's based on first
