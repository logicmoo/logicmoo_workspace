Hey, there I was thinking about going and seeing a movie. Would you like to go?
I have not been to a movie in years. They are to expensive.
I know they are expensive sometimes but I like to go to a matinee because they are cheaper.
That might be an option.
I also like to go to matinee's because there are normally fewer people.
That sounds like a great reasons to go to matinees.
What kind of movie would you liek to go see?
I like all kinds of movies except horror type ones.
I see there are several that I would like to go to. Maybe you can help narrow it down a bit,.
I definatly do not want to go see any romance type drama movies this time around.
I found Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales or Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Which one sounds better to you?
I have not seen Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Is there any other options besides Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales?
What about The Fate of the Furious or King Arthur: Legend of the Sword? I really like period pieces.
Now that is a hard decision to make between all three movies. I also like period pieces.
If we are going to go see King Arthur: Legend of the Sword during a matinee time it looks like it is only showing at 3:05pm today. Does that work for you?
I am not sure I can do that today. is it showing tomorrow around the same time? If it is I can do it tomorrow.
They have it at either 3:25 or 4.30 tomorrow. Which time works best for you?
I would like to go to the later one at  4.30 tomorrow.
Sounds great! I will meet you at my house at 3:45pm so we can go together to the movie.
Sound good to me. See you tomorrow.
