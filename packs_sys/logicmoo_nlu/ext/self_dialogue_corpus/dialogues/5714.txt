What do you think about The Little Mermaid?
I love that movie!
What do you like most about it?
Probably the music, every song is SO good.
What's your favorite song in that movie?
That's a really hard question, but probably "Under the Sea"
That song is so much fun, it's hard to not just get up and dance and sing along!
Exactly! Do you have a favorite song?
Still a hard questions, but maybe "Part of your World"
That's a great one too, you really feel Ariel's longing to be human.
