Hey do you think of that Disney movie snow white?
I loved snow white, everything from the songs to the animation.
Hey do you remember Elsa from Frozen, do you think she was evil with her ice powers?
Not at all she just simply did not under stand how to control it.
That song Let it Go from Frozen its really catchy isn't it.
Yea I found it catchy but it gets stuck in my head so I hate it now.
Did you find the Lion King to be a sad movie ?
overall I did not find it sad but that part where Simba's dad died made me cry.
Do you like happy endings such as Beauty and the Beast?
Yup I really do love the warm feelings of a happy ending.
