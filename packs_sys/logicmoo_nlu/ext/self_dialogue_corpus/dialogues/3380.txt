Are you more of a Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street fan?
I'm definitely more of a Friday the 13th fan. I've watched the whole series of 10 and the remake countless of times.
I think I started off more of a Nightmare on Elm Street fan but after they made Freddy Krueger too comical, it lost me.
Yeah I think I with Friday the 13th you know what you're getting with Jason, he never says a word, he just goes on his way with his cleansing of Crystal Lake.
Actually Jason does go through changes. Did you notice ever since Friday the 13th Part 2 and on, he obtained something new each movie.
What do you mean? I know they kill him off every movie but he comes back some how. I'm not sure about the changes you mentioned.
Well excluding the first one, which was his mother as the killer, in the second one he got the sack over his head, the third one he got the mask, the fourth one the machete, the fifth one we don't count since it wasn't him, the sixth one he's basically a zombie revived, the seventh one is when Kane Hodder took over the role of Jason, the eighth one he can basically teleport, the ninth one he's reborn, the tenth one he's a cyborg!
Oh I see! Yes, he definitely does gain something every movie. I think my favorite was either the 4th one or the 6th one. I did find the seventh one, The New Blood, interesting with Tina and her telekinetic powers.
I think Friday the 13th Part 7, the New Blood, is definitely underrated. It gets a bad rap because the studio had to cut a lot of footage to get in to go into the ratings.
I wish we got 7 in it's entirety some of the footage I saw looked pretty brutal. I think it would of been a top three if it was released as the director intended.
