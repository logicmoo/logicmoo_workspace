Did you know the Bills haven't made the playoffs since Tom Brady was at Michigan?
I knew it was quite a while. It is hard to win in the AFC East.
Yeah, the Patriots, Patriots! I remember when the Bills were near great. Four consecutive Superbowl appearances!
All losses.I think they should have won at least one of those.
Scott Norwood, the kicker, shanked a 48 yard fild goal.It would have beat Dallas.
Well, at least they got there four times. The Dolphins, just one appearance since the beginning of the Marino era. That, also, was a loss.
The Jets are nearly as bad.They won their only SB when Namath called it against the Colts.
It just proves how dominant the Patriots are.
I remember when the Pats went 1-15 under Rod Rust!
Rust was a great defensive coach.He just was not the head coach type.
The best tackle any Patriot made before the Bill Era was John "Bull" Bramlett tackling a fan who ran onto the field.
I remember.He really leveled him.Those were the days!
It is amazing how the Patriots turned it around.It really started with the hiring of Chuck Fairbanks from Oklahoma
He came in and they changed the culture.They should have won the Superbowl in the late 70s!
The ref, Ben Dreith, made a phantom holding call on Ray Hamilton. It won the game for the Raiders.
I remember that well.It still irks me!
Well, look at us now.Is it possible to be sick of winning?
Well, we are both old enough to remember Carl Garrett, Mike Taliferio, ad nauseum. They were lucky to win 4 games a year!
I guess I will take the present!
Go Pats in 2017!
