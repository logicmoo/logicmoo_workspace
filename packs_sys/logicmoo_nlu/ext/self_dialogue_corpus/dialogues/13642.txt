Do you like the original Star Wars trilogy best or the newer films?
I think they're all good in their own right, but I tend to prefer the original trilogy.
But the new movies don't have the same great writing or inventiveness and the acting is miserable by comparison!
I wouldn't say that Mark Hamil was particularly talented, would you?
Not really, no.  But Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford gave classic performances!
That's true but part of that could just be nostalgia for a film series that was so innovative and new compared to other sci-fi movies from earlier eras.
That's true.  And the new movies do have excellent production quality and provide interesting background and cool story arc advancement.
I agree.  I like that the origins of Darth Vader were made clear along with the fall of the Jedi.  I also like seeing the resurgence of the Rebels.
But don't you think there were some things that just didn't fit in with the Anakin Skywalker storyline?  Like the Gungans, for example?
I do agree that it seems like George Lucas just wanted another Ewok-like culture to drive sales, as the Gungans really were not essential to the story.  But they provided an impetus for Amadala's actions in Episode 1, even if it was a weak one.
