So, have you seen any good horror movies recently?
Oh yeah, I actually have. I just saw the new Mummy movie, the one with Tom Cruise.
Really? How was it? I heard it wasn't very good. At least it seemed that a lot of critics didn't seem to like it.
I actually thought it was pretty good. It was a good, summer tentpole, popcorn movie.
What did you like about it? How much was it like the classic Universal monster movies?
Well, I definitely liked how they portrayed the Mummy. She felt both new and interesting, but, at the same time, still grounded in the world of Universal's classic monsters. Also, the overall movie had a neat sort of classic, B-Moive monster movie vibe to it.
Oh, that is kind of cool. Where there any other references in the movie to Universal's other monsters?
Yeah, there totally were. I don't want to say exactly what they were because I don't want to spoil anything, but I would say definitely keep an eye out when the main characters reach the "lab."
That sounds pretty cool! Maybe I will check it out.
I would. You will for sure be entertained!
