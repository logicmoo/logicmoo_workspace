Hey Babe my buddy invited me to go see this movie with him called Beauty and the beast.
Oh yeah that's cool i heard about that movie but i did not get to see it yet. Was it good?
Excellent I love that movie it is actually one of my favorites ever since. you can be unattractive and still have a beautiful heart.
So It really makes people realize that love does not have to be perfect it just has to be true. It don,t matter if you are not the prettiest person.
I know and they have so may different movies and cartoons that have came out since i seen it.
Um do you know who starred in the cartoon movies or any one of them I want to take my daughter to go see it. or I'll order one.
Well yeah I know Bella,Vincent and gaston starred in one of them they were all great fairytale actors.
Wow this is going to be great I may take my next store neighbor's her friends along with us or invite them over.
Good it,s a very good movie for kids it gives them a happy spirit and it has a beautiful ending.
Okay thanks will do I like to see the children in good spirits and they can learn from such a story of love.
