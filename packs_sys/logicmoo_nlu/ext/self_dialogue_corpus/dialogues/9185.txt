So, you listen to rock, still?
Yeah, 60's, 70's, and 80's. That was the high point in rock music.
Wow. It sounds like wailing and screaming to me. Who are some of your favorite bands?
Led Zeppelin, Rush, Van Halen, Areosmith, AC/DC...all the usual suspects.
Yeah, I like Aerosmith's song "Don't Wanna Miss a Thing." I'm kinds interested in getting into more rock music.
In my opinion, start off with the Rolling Stones, Credence Clearwater Revival...those 60's bands. If you go year by year, you hear a progression of sound.
What about the British Invasion?
Definitely go with The Who, Rolling Stones, even the Beatles. Read about some of their influences and you'll expand your horizons, musically.
Thanks. I'll check them out.
Good deal. The best thing to do is put in earbuds, lie back, close your eyes, and feel the music...something you can't do with most music today.
