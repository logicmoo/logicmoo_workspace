Did you hear about the song Simon Cowell produced for charity?
No, what chairty is it for?
All the proceeds are going to the London Commuinty Foundation, which will give it out to needy families and victims from the Grenfell Tower fire.
Oh, I heard all about the fire of course. That was horrible. Those poor people, it broke my heart.
I'm sure there are a lot of people needing help, covering funeral and medical expenses, finding a new place to live, replacing all their belongings.
What's the song called Simon produced?
It's a cover song of the Simon and Garfunkel hit, Bridge Over Troubled Water.
That is a really touching song. Who's singing it?
There's more than 50 artists singing on the song.
Wow, a lot of people wanted to help. That's great that they would all want to support those poor people.
Rita Ora, Louis Tomlinson, James Blunt, Robbie Williams, and Jessie J, are a few of the singers on the recording.
So it's being sold as a single to help raise money?
Yes, as a digital download. And it was played on radio stations across the UK Wednesday morning so people could hear it, and hopefully go buy the single.
I'm sure anyone listening would think that was a worthy song to pay for the down load.
Simon also tweeted that hopefully, people who are able to would also donate extra money to the foundation raising money for the victims.
It seems like disasters and tragedies really need all the help they can get, so it's great that the music industry tries to help.
A famous London hip-hop artist did the opening of the song, and rapped about never forgetting them.
Sometimes people want to help after tragedies, but they really don't know how to help.
I'm sure to a lot of people who were affected by or victims of this, having this song will help them not feel so alone in their loss and problems.
It lets them know that people care, people who don't even know them, famous people who sang it, and everyday normal people who bought it to help support them.
