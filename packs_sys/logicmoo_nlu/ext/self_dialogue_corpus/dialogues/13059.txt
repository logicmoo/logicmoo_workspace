I really don't think there has been a good Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back.
Well, the franchise certainly peaked with the first two movies, but do not discount the impact of the 6 movies.
I suppose Rogue One was ok, but it was only ok because it was such a  departure from the Lucas Films format.
Rogue One was a departure in that the themes and structure were different, but it stayed true to the universe and source material.
But all the characters in Rogue One, like Jyn Erso, K-2SO, and Cassian Andor were some much more multi-faceted and believable that what had been churned out since Return of the Jedi.
Darth Vader was in Rogue One. He is what made Return of the Jedi and all three of the Prequels enjoyable.
I would argue with you that The Phantom Menace (1999) II,  Attack of the Clones (2002) III, and Revenge of the Sith (2005) IV were not enjoyable at all.
Matter of opinion, my friend. Yes, the actors playing Anakin were all wooden and lame, but we were able to see the Jedi council and learn about the birth of the Empire.
Honestly, I preferred the now non-cannon novels and comicbooks' explanations of those things. The CGI Yodi and Liam Nessen and Sam Jackson mailing it in did nothing for me.
Let's agree to disagree on the Prequels than. But we can both agree that A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back were amazing!
