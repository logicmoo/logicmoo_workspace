You have seen Logan correct?
Yes , I have see all the x men and wolverine movies.
Can we discuss Dafne Keen, was she not excellent?
Is that the actress playing laura the little girl?
Yep that is her, at first I thought she may have been the girl from stranger things who plays eleven.
Funny I wondered the same thing at first. They are both such strong little girls and big talents.
I especially like Dafne. I know she did not say too much but that is one sign of a good actor.
I agree not much dialogue wise for her but she pulled her weight and was able to emote so well no words were needed to feel her emotions.
Exactly and to have that skill and power at such a young age is so impressive to me.
i bet she has a high IQ a lot of child stars do. I think at least you have to have a certain understanding to grasp the scenes for what they are or the director is really good.
