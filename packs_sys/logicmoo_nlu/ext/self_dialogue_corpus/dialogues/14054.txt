So I found out an interesting fact about Lady Gaga.
Oh yeah, what's that?
Did you know that she used to primarily write songs for other people to preform?
I think I remember hearing that before. Who did she write for?
Well, back in the day,she co-wrote songs for The Pussycat Dolls, Fergie and New Kids On The Block.
Wow, I always thought New Kids On The Block wrote their own songs.
Nope. Most singing groups like that have someone else writing their lyrics.
Oh, I didn't know. So what did you find out about Lady Gaga?
She wrote two tracks for Jennifer Lopez’s new album Love.
Oh wow, I love that album! Its so cool that Lady Gaga helped write some songs for it!
