Did you see the latest Star Wars yet?
Rogue One? Yes, but on dvd, did you like it?
No I thought it was awful, money grab type of thing.
You think it was worse than episode one?
Yeah, I think it was way worse. Did you see they are making a Han Solo Stand Alone?
No, I did not. How will they do that if he is dead?
The solo, Solo film is set when he was younger, kind of like the first set of prequels, you think you will see it?
Yeah I am sure I will check it out. Do you think they will add a stupid character like Jar Jar Binks?
I am sure they will add a useless one.But I liked Jar Jar didn't you?
No, he was awful.Almost as bad as kid Anakin.
I really liked kid Anakin. I was freaked out by the Padme relationship, what was your take on that?
Padme and Anakin? I thought it was actually cool, I think Natalie Portman played it well, do you think she will somehow come back in any other Star Wars movies?
I do not see how she could, unless it was a pre- Prequel. Do you think they will try to have "ghost" Anaking played by Hayden Christianson in any of the new films?
I am sure they will. Did you see that other movie he made, Jumper?
Yeah I did a long time ago. Did you think it was any good?
I actually hated every second of it. It did remind me of Inception somehow though, the camera angles and mystery at least.Have you seen that one?
Yes, I love Inception, so weird but so good. Did you ever see Leo's part in Titanic?
You know, I have never! Is it a good Cameron movie?
Yeah it is a real romantic, but also an epic. Like Avatar, did you dig that one?
Yes, I liked the way he wove all the story in with such ease on a crazy premise. Executed well don't you think?
