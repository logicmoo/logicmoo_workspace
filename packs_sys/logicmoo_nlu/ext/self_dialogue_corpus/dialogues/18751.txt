Who do you prefer: Katy Perry or Taylor Swift?
Taylor Swift definitely. I found 1989 to be the best pop album of the past five years.
Really? I found singles like Shake it Off and Out of the Woods to be very cliche and vapid.
I wouldn't go that far, but I would say that I'd rather focus on the album's better songs, such as Blank Space, Style, and Wildest Dreams.
I would agree that Blank Space was the album's best song, but Style and Wildest Dreams are mediocre at best.
Really, please give me two songs that Katy Perry has released that compare to Style and Wildest Dreams in terms of quality.
Easy, Teenage Dream and Thinking of You.
I will concede that Teenage Dream is superior to both songs, but not to Blank Space. Also, Thinking of You was such a minor song.
Yeah, but it is her best ballad. It is so much better than songs like Firework or Roar.
Isn't it interesting that you had to go back over five years to choose two songs that are better than two more recent Taylor Swift songs?
It's not my fault that Katy Perry hasn't released a great album since 2010. However, Witness is fun at least.
I just find the lyrics to her songs to be either too vapid or frankly too vulgar.
When you say too vulgar, are you referring to Bon Appétit?
Of course. I find the music video where they are making Katy Perry to appear as food very weird and kind of gross.
I think that it's weird, but clever. Also, I enjoy the verse that Migos does a lot.
I can't understand those guys at all.
While they are difficult to understand, their unique sound is so interesting and fun to hear.
That might be the difference between us. I tend to prefer strong lyrics in a song, which could explain why I prefer Taylor Swift.
Okay, but from that respect, all of her songs lyrics are about ex-boyfriends. Doesn't that get repetitive?
Well my favorite songs of hers are the songs about successful relationships, like Love Story and Mine.
