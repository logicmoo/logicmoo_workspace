I hate the type of rap music that's popular now. It's so meaningless.
You sound like my mother... While I don't identify with it, I still respect it.
Why would you? It does nothing but support violence, bad values, and we have no idea what they're saying!
I don't like country music either, but who am I to judge people that do. At the end of the day, lot of young people like the new rap, and there are even a few great artists that are inspirational.
They're all terrible. Name One that is inspirational.
Kendrick Lamar is.
I wouldn't call Kendrick Lamar rap. He's more like pop these days.
Kendrick Lamar is 100% rap. It's not even hip-hop - it's pure rap.
I have to admit that he is a good example. He's the only rapper who I've ever heard giving positing messages in his music.
So you haven't heard of Nas, Common... shall I go on? Maybe you need to listen to rap more instead of making generalized stereotypes.
