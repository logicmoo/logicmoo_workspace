Did you enjoy Basic Instinct or Basic Instinct 2?
Basic Instinct 2 was trash. Sharon Stone was in it but Michael Douglas didn't return for it.
I don't blame Michael Douglas for not coming back for Basic Instinct 2. The fact they made a second one is a shame.
Did Sharon Stone do any other notable movies after Basic Instinct. She sort of just disappeared after being such a big star during that time.
She was in a few movies I remember such as the mother in Alpha Dog and various other roles that I can't recall right now.
Alpha Dog is the movie with Emile Hirsch, Anton Yelchin, and Justin Timberlake right?
Yeah that's the movie, Amber Heard, Olivia Wilde, and Amanda Seyfried were also in it.
What a star studded cast. I guess Sharon Stone just got older and stopped getting rolls. Basic instinct was probably her most notable role.
She was terrific in Basic Instinct. It was such an intense thriller, you kept wondering if she was the murderer.
I know, the movie was very sexy, but very mysterious and dark too, a perfect thriller in my opinion.
