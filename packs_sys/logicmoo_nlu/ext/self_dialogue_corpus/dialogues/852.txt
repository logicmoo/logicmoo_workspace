Who do you want to win the Superbowl this year?
I definitely want the Detroit Lions to win.
Do you think they have a chance, coming off that disappointing first round loss in the playoffs.
Well I think they took a step forward last year, even with the loss of Megatron.
Yes, but Matthew Stafford pretty much carried the team, he can't do that every year.
Well, they had alot of injuries, so he was forced to.
So you think they can do it, if they stay healthy.
I'm hopeful that they can.
I definitely want the Cowboys to take it home.
Did you hear about the recent news with Dak Prescott?
No, what happened?
He used an auto-pen to sign a bunch of football cards.
Well that's kind of immoral.
Yeah, and it's been a week and he hasn't said anything about it.
He's probably waiting for his lawyers to release a statement, what about the card manufacturers?
No, Panini hasn't said anything either.
Well that's a bad situation, but I still want them to win.
If Dak and Ezekiel can have a crazy sophomore season, I think there's a chance.
Me too, hopefully they can keep the off field issues under control.
It'd be crazy if Dak got suspended for it!
