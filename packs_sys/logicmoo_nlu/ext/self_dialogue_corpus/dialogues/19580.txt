I used to think I'd always be aware of the most recent music, but I'm not. I still like older songs.
You know, while there are some great older songs, there are still some pretty cool new songs.
I realize I should try harder maybe, I still find  myself listening to The Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, and The Rolling Stones.
Those are great groups. Which group is your favorite.
I usually say the Rolling Stones, but I also like Bob Seger and songs from the 1960s.
Do you listen to the music every day.
I don't, but I still find myself listening to music every week. I always listen to the older songs when in the car.
Do you listen to the radio?
No. I live in a rural area and have trouble picking up a station I like. I have quite a few songs on the computer. So I've put music on CDs.
Do you find yourself listening to the same bands before changing the CD?
No. I try to put a mix of different artists on each CD to make it more like I'm listening to the radio. I would get bored, I think, listening to just one artist.
What types of songs do you listen to?
Some of the CDs are country music. Some are oldies, rock or pop. Usually, I don't mix the different types of songs on the same CD.
How do you choose which CD you want to listen to?
I usually just randomly pick a CD. If I'm not in the mood to listen to that CD, I may switch to another one.
How many songs do you get on a CD?
There's usually around 20 songs per CD, and I have maybe 20 CDs in the car.
That's quite a few songs you have.
I think so. I don't drive all that much since I'm retired, but it's plenty to keep me entertained. I do like my music.
Sounds great. I wish I took the time to make my own CDs.
