I was listening to some Jazz music the other night and I loved it! Do you know any good Jazz musicians I could listen to?
Yes, sure. Do you like the older style of Jazz, or do you want to listen to some newer music?
Really I'm not sure. I think I would like both of them, or any types of Jazz.
Well, to start off, you may want to listen to some classics, like Miles Davis.
I've heard of him, what should I listen to of his first?
There is so much good music from him, but my favorite is him album called Kind if Blue. It was one of his most popular albums.
Isn't he one of the most popular Jazz musicians?
Actually, most people regard him as one of the most popular and talented musicians of the 20th century.
Wow, I had no idea!  I can't wait to check out his music.
Another musician you might like is Cab Calloway. He was amazing! His popular music goes all the way back to the 1930's.
Didn't he sing and also play instruments?
Yes he did. One of his most popular songs that he sang is from 1930 is called Minnie the Moocher. It was number one on the music charts in the U.S.A.
He sounds great! Do you have someone that is still recording music that I can check out?
Sure, one of my newer favorite artists is Wynton Marsalis. He's been playing for years and is still performing.
What is his music like?
His current music is more contemporary and modern. He plays the trumpet and is the best I've ever heard. He has even won nine Grammy Awards!
Wow, he sounds amazing. I will definitely have to check out his music.
Do you think I have given you enough music ideas to start with?
Yes! You have really helped me out with a lot to listen to and see if I like.
Good. I'm glad I could help, and let me know what you like the best.
