So, which Star Wars movie is the best, in your humble opinion?
For me, it'd have to be The Empire Strikes Back.
Yes, for me, that's the most emotionally resonant of the movies...
And also the darkest, with such a brutal, sad ending and cliffhanger.
Yeah, I can't imagine having to wait three years after Empire Strikes Back to find out what happened.
It had to feel like a bit of a letdown, Return of the Jedi.
You see such great characters we know very little about in Empire Strikes Back, like Boba Fett.
He's just so mysterious and cool, and it's definitely sad how he dies early on in Jedi.
Some people say that it was Lawrence Kasdan who really made Empire Strikes Back a great film.
Yes, I wonder if he is a better director than Lucas, or maybe better at executing Lucas' ideas and concepts?
