So I am looking for some good movies to watch while I am healing from my surgery. Any suggestions?
Well, you know I love movies. You are going to need to be a little more specific as to what type of move.
Well, maybe a mixture of movies I can watch when my little kids are around and some to watch with my husband when they go to sleep. My husband and I like historical movies.
Well, as far as kids movies go I would have to suggest some of the newer movies that I have seen. What about Zootopia?
I haven't seen that. What is it about?
It is about a little rabbit who wants to be a police officer but faces a lot of obstacles even once she is successful.
Sounds like a good movie with a good lesson.
I like it when kids movies have good takeaways for the kids to learn.
Any other suggestions?
Well for you and your husband I would reccomend one of my favorites-The Pianist.
What time period is that set during?
It is set during World War Two in Poland.
I am liking it so far, what is the plot like?
A professional pianist is Jewish, which obviously creates problems when the Nazis invade. He ends up being in hiding to avoid concentration camps.
Now that sounds good. I love those kinds of movies!
The really cool part is that it is based on real life events.
Can I ask for a spoiler?
I suppose. What do you want to know?
Does the piano player make it?
Well, if you must know-yes, he does.
