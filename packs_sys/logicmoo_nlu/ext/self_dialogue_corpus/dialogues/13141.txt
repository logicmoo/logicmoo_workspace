Did you hear they're going to some how keep Princess Leia in the next Star Wars film?
I did read some articles about it. I think it's going to be really fascinating especially after the passing of Carrie Fisher.
I know I was so saddened that day. I'm really interested to see how Lucasfilms will include her. Do you think she'll get a reunion with Kylo Ren?
I think if they somehow manage to use Princess Leia, there has to be some moment with her son Kylo Ren.
It's such a fascinating story line they're creating if you think about it.
I know, we still don't know about Rey, we're not sure if Kylo is going to turn, we have no clue where Finn's character is heading. Then there's Poe the ace pilot, he still needs more story.
There's so much to look forward to. I hope the next one we get more of a backstory on Poe too. The chemistry between him and Finn was great. I was sad when Han Solo died though.
That was tragic! He gave himself to his son and Kylo ended him.
Such a powerful moment, I felt such anger. I rooted for Rey when she took down Kylo Ren.
I know! We haven't even mentioned Luke's role yet!
