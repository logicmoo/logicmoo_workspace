Who was your favorite Beatle?
McCartney.
Why him?
Each of the Beatles was great. I just think McCartney was the greatest of them.
Why is he so great?
He's a great singer, a great musician. Do you know how many musical instruments he can play?
What about Harrison?
George Harrison was great. I was never that big of a fan when he was a Beatle. He always blended into the background. He got better after the group broke up.
And Ringo Starr?
He was a drummer. I heard him sing later on. Never liked any of his songs. Liked him in Thomas the Tank Engine though.
