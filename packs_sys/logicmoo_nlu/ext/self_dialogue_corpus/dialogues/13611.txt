Have you seen the movie Rogue One?
Oh yeah, that's one of my favorite Star wars movies so far. Did you like it?
Yeah, I was just really sad about the ending. I liked K2S0 a lot, and I didn't like what happened to him.
That's true but we knew this was going to be a one off. And Director Krennik was really a great character.
I definitely agree. Also having Mads Mikkelson in the movie was excellent.
Yeah the cast was pretty awesome. The last twenty minutes are my favorite part, although it made me sad.
It's interesting to see the forming of the rebellion and the death star plans for sure. Who was your favorite character?
I'd have to say Cassian I think. He's very cool, and he's not afraid to get his hands dirty.
I think the pacing with that movie was perfect. Like they did everything just right.
You're right, it was great. And the battle at the end while they were trying to steal the plans was really epic.
