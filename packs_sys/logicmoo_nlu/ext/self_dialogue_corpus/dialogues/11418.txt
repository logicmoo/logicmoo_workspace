To me, it was like The Beatles changed everthing. They picked rock up and shook it, and put it down somewhere else.
Yet they had influences, of course, like anybody. They didn't just spring out of nowhere.
I know that when they were getting started, at the Star Club in Hamburg, Little Richard was playing there too.
I know when Paul McCartney was in school he idolized Little Richard.
And John praised him too. They all admired his musical daring, I imagine.
Yeah. When the Beatles were inducted into the Rock Hall of Fame Harrison said they wouldn't be there if not for Little Richard.
I heard Little Richard was there for the ceremony, and Harrison pointed at him and said, "It's all his fault, really."
Funny. But Harrison's big influence was Ravi Shankar. That's where the boys got all the sitar music.
I heard Harrison studied with him in India.
And Lennon was influenced by his poor mother, who couldn't raise him but taught him banjo and gave him a guitar.
