You seen any good movies recently?
Well, I watched a pretty cool documentary yesterday.
Please, documentaries do not count as movies; anything cooler than that?
Sure they do! A lot of documentaries have a lot of thought and planning behind them, and the cinematography can be beautiful.
Maybe the technical side's all right, but the movie itself is always super boring.
Have you ever watched a documentary?
Yeah, like whenever my grandfather had the history channel on or something.
No no, I mean like a documentary that's more than just made for tv and longer than an hour.
Why would I want to be bored for even longer than an hour?
Trust me, some documentaries are really great and fascinating, you just have to find one that talks about something you're interested in.
Okay, okay, I'll bite. What did you watch yesterday?
It's a YouTube Red documentary called Kedi, and it's about cats.
...You watched a documentary, over an hour long, about cats. You're not selling the idea here.
No no, it was actually really cool. It's about the way people and cats interact with each other in Istanbul.
Why is Turkey so special? Are they the ones that worship cats or something?
That was ancient Egypt, and no. The reason Istanbul is special is because no one owns cats, they just live alongside them.
What do you mean?
So, all the street cats just interact with the humans like they're people. They go in people's homes and stores and stuff any time they want.
What? How does that work?
It's pretty cool and a neat perspective on our relationship with animals. Of course, to find out more, you'd have to watch the documentary. Not so boring now, huh?
