What's your whole take on the pre-Sgt. Pepper versus post-Sgt. Pepper Beatles?
Oh, you mean the whole short hair versus long-hair thing they did?
Kind of, but...including the change in their music style...
Well, remember...their manager Brian Epstied OD'ed around that time...
Yeah, tragically true...but...hmmm....you know, their overall style was evolving prior to losing Epstein.
They were all doing LSD and other drugs.  Today everything they were doing would be considered absolutely illegal, but back then....  all the uppers, hallucinogens, other stuff...who knows...it helped fuel some creative drive, and it wasn't really against the law yet...  But, yeah, drugs had some influence, I think.
Maybe also they had experienced so much in such a short time.  Maybe something within John, Paul, George and Ringo collectively changed with their common experiences of being on the road, doing everything together, etc.  The insanity of it all--of Beatlemania--maybe that did something to them and had something to do with their shift in styles...
Could be...or maybe it was who they were with.  They were all in serious relationships with girlfriends and wives at that point...
True...that could have made some of a difference in their style changes...  Just fascinating.  Wish we could know 100% for sure.  It would be amazing if we could just bottle up the essence of their overall magic...
Paul and Ringo are still around...  Wish we could get ALL their secrets somehow...
