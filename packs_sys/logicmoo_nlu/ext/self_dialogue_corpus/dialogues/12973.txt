Hey man, how do you weigh in on the Han shot first deal?
Eh, I don't really like talking about that stuff. Lucas kinda ruined a New Hope for me.
Why? because he changed it around?
it's not just turned around. Making Greedo shoot first took away a lot of Han's coolness.
Why does it matter so much? Doesn't it make him more of a good guy?
No! Han isn't a good guy in the first place. He's a scoundrel!
I didn't think it was that big a deal and I thought it was good to make him a little nicer.
You are killing me, nice? Han isn't nice. He's supposed to be a wild west cowboy type.
I don't know, his best friends are a princess, a dog man and a magic boy, how much of a tough guy should he really be?
I don't I can ever watch star wars with you again.
