Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
I really like Yoda.
He is really cool.  That fight with him and Count Dooku was so awesome because you finally see how powerful he is.
I wish there were more characters like him in the Star Wars universe. It seems like a lot of the characters are humanoid and not enough aliens.
That's true.  You'd think in the whole big galaxy humans would be kind of a blip in the radar but Lucas had mostly humans.
He used a lot of great practical effects though in 4,5, and 6 I heard.
I heard he gave kept his franchising rights like for the toys and stuff and everyone thought he was crazy.
I bet they don't think that now do they?
Yeah, he made millions from all that stuff then sold it to Disney for even more money.
I hope Disney keeps on making good Star Wars movies.
