Have you ever seen fight club?
Of course, that's a classic.
Yea Tyler Durden is such a cool character.
Well, Brad Pitt makes everything look pretty cool.
Yea, I still don't really get what that movie is about though.
You don't like it?
No, I do! I just feel like it has this huge meaning that I'm not really getting.
Yea I get that sense too. I mean I know it's an anti-coporate movie. But I feel like there's more.
The ending was one of the best twists I had ever seen at the time.
Same here, it totally blew me away.
