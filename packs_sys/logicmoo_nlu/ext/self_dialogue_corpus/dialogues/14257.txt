I just refuse to get on the Seth Curry bandwagon.
Why is that?  He's putting up numbers like crazy since he's been with the Warriors.
He just isn't a good all around baskeball player.
What do you mean?
He doesn't actually play defense, he just stands there, waiting for one of his teammates to pass him the ball, so he can shoot.
Yeah, what's wrong with being able to shoot?
Nothing is wrong with it, and it's a great part of the basketball game, but there are so many other parts he doesn't even try to play!
Yeah, I can see that.  He is an amazing shooter though.  He's one of the best.
Hardly, I mean you're forgetting about the greats, man.
Who are the greats then?  Who is better?
Well, let's see, Reggie Miller, Steve Nash, Larry Bird, to name a few, and that's shooters who also played defense.
What do you mean, he isn't even the best in his own field of 3's?
No, he's mediocre, at best compared to the greats.  Sure he can hit a 3 from half court, but so could many many many others, who also found the time and energy to play defense.
I see what you're saying, he just isn't as good in his own environment?
Exactly, I mean he isn't even the best shooter of all time, let alone the best basketball player.
Yeah, did you see that ESPN interview where they were comparing him to a young Kobe or even the great Michael Jordan?
Yeah, that's what sent me on this rant.  It's like, you people are supposed to be professionals and to actually know your basketball history.
No, come on, you know they just get ex players to talk about those games, and those players are so biased it's unreal.
Exactly, it's just like they are all over his jock because he's relevant and popular now, not even considering the history of basketball.
I get what you're saying, he really is overrated.
