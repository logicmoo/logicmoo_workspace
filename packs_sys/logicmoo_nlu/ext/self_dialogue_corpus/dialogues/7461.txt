Do you every think about how young Snow White was?
What do you mean?
She's supposedly only 14 years old in the movie!
What? No way!
Yes! Which is even more devastating when you think about how the Queen treated her.
She was just a kid!
Atleast with all that work she had to do, she held her own well in the dwarf cottage.
Yes, they really appreciated her cleaning and cooking for them.
And she was married at 14 also!
To be fair you'd married a prince at 14 if it meant being far away from an evil witch mother.
