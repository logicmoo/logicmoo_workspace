Hey what was you favorite horror movie?
Hands down John Carpenter's The Thing.
Really? What is the reason you chose that old film?
It's a classic! It's story is impossible to reliably copy and pull off today.
It was just another alien flick?
No, it was an alien that assumed the identity of those it killed. The old film really had you guessing who was who.
That's true. I will admit it was and still is a cult classic.
Don't you remember they were going to do a remake a few years ago but the director said he didn't want to ruin the film so he did a prequel instead.
That was suppose to be a remake? I'm glad it wasn't, because you were able to tell who was killed outright.
Exactly, the original never eluded to who was killed and in what order. The film was perfect in my opinion and modern day directors should really take note of that element.
