What do the think of today's musical artists?
I'm not really impressed with the music being made today.  I'm more of a classic rock fan.
Oh really?  Why don't you like today's stuff?
It just doesn't appeal to me as much as the older stuff does.
Have you really given it a try?
Well, not really.  When I was younger, I would listen to the radio in my car, and I do like some stuff from the 80's and 90's.
Why nothing later than that?
The rock stations I was listening to started playing more classic rock, and I found I really enjoyed that.  Then, one time in the early 2000's when I rented a car, it had Sirius radio in it and I found a station called 70's on 7.
So that station just played 70's music?
Yes, pop music mostly, from the 70's.  That turned me on to Sirius.  So the next car we bought, we made sure it had Sirius radio.
So what other stations do you listen to?
I really like Classic Vinyl and Classic Rewind.  They play 60's, 70's on Classic Vinyl, and 70's and 80's rock on Classic Rewind.
Why do you enjoy that type of music so much?
The late 70's and early 80's were my teenage years and so I listened to music and went to concerts a lot during that time.  Of course, I haven't ever stopped going to concerts!
Oh really?  Who do you go see?
I'm a huge Beatles fan, so I've seen Paul McCartney seven times.  And I've seen The Who, The Rolling Stones a few times.  I also had a chance to see Three Dog Night - they're one of my favorite bands from the 70's.
How was that show?  Aren't they a little old?
Yep, they are.  But they can still rock on!  In fact, fairly soon after my husband and I went to see them, one of the lead singers, Cory Wells, passed away.  That was in 2015.  Sad.
That's too bad.  Do you think they'll stop touring?
Yes, I bet they will.
