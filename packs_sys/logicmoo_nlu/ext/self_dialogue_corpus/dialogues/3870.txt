Hey, are you familiar with the film The Losers.
A little, I know it based on a comic series, but not much more than that.
Well, the Losers are a CIA Black Ops team.
Okay, the name is explained, but what about the plot?
The Losers are sent on a search and destroy mission to eliminate a Bolivian drug kingpin, but things go wrong.
How so?
It turns out the kingpin uses child labor and that puts kids at ground zero for the airstrike they just called in.
So I take it they try to help save the kids.
Yes, but that ends with them disavowed and legally dead, while their sinister superior, called Max, works a bloody plot to make the US number one no matter how many innocent people have to die.
Okay, sounds like a interesting fillm, I'll have to check it out.
