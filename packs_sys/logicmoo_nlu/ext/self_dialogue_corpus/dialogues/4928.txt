Did you see the extra-inning game between the Cubs and Yankees last night?
I fell asleep in the 14th inning, what happened?
The Yankees ended up winning in the 18th, I think it was past 1 a.m. local time
Jeez, so the Cubs got swept at home?
Yeah, and they're not even in first place anymore...
Who is? The Cardinals?
I think the Reds actually. But everyone is jumbled up within a few games of the lead.
Cubs were about 10 games up at this point last year? They must have the World Series hangover.
Yeah, didn't they start like 25-10 or something? This year they're barely .500
They only went 1-5 against Red Sox and Yankees over the past week or so.
Yeah, doesn't look good if they end up meeting those teams in October
Yankees are playing really well though. I think they are something like 20-9, with one of the best records in baseball
How are your Diamondbacks doing?
They lost 2 of 3 to Colorado in Denver over the weekend, still in second place but now 2 and a half games back
That division is all upside down this year. The Giants are way under .500
They're in last place and look absolutely dreadful. They're the reason the Reds are in first.
Yeah, they got swept in Cincinnati. And the Dodgers have been so-so. Although we knew the Padres would stink.
If D-backs can find some pitching they can win the division. Not sold on Rockies yet
Yeah, they're bats go silent outside Denver usually
They host the Cubs tonight for a series
