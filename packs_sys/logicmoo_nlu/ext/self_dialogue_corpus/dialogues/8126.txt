Do you like Katy Perry?
I like most of her music, but especially her song "Dark Horse".
Thats a great song. What do you think about her feud with Taylor Swift?
I can't believe it has gotten so out of hand. Its really time to squash it already.
You know when Taylor Swift came out with "Bad Blood" I knew it was going to be an ongoing feud for a good while.
"Bad Blood" was so obviously about Katy, but Katy has had a bit more couth with her retaliation.
I wish they would go back to being good friends, put this stupidity behind them, and move forward as an unstoppable girl power house.
A Katy Perry and Taylor Swift collab would be a great way to put it all to rest. It had been hinted at, but has never come to fruition.
Hopefully this year we will see the feud end and with that get an amazing pop song from two of the hottest female pop stars of this decade.
I agree. Fans are ready, the world is ready, its time for the ultimate pop collab!
