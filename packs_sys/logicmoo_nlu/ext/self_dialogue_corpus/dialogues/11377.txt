When I was younger, I went through a phase when the only band I listened to was the Beatles.
Really? When I was little I used to listen to them with my mom.
Was she a Beatles fan?
Yes, but she was too young for true Beatlemania. She told me she cried the day they broke up.
Ha ha, my father used to claim that that was John Lennon's wife's fault. But I heard recently that she had nothing to do with it.
Yoko Ono. Didn't she recently get credit for helping to write "Imagine?"
I heard that too. That is such an awesome song.
My favorite Beatles song is "Blackbird." What is yours?
I like "Oh Blah Di."
That's a good one.
