I was so sad to hear Robin William killed himself. He was one of the best actors ever.
I know, I loved him in Good Will Hunting.
That was a great movie. It really made you think about letting go of people you love and how you want to live your life.
I loved it when Chuckie told Will if he came over in 20 years to watch a ball game and he was still there, he was going to kill him.
I know and when he said, you got something none of the rest of us have.
Chuckie was a good friend to Will, it is hard to know your friend is better than you and encourage them to be the best they can be.
Especially knowing more than likely you are going to lose that friend to his new life.
I like the part where Chuckie tells him you owe it to me, it would be an insult to us if you are still here in 20 years.
I like the role Robin played to and when he told the story about his wife.
He has something about him that makes you want to protect him.
I have never seen him in a movie that I did not believe he was not that character.
He was so good in Dead Poets Society in 1989.
I loved that movie so much. What about Patch Adams?
Yeah, why do I ever get a doctor like that? I wouldn't mind getting a check up every now and then if the doctors acted like they were more caring.
That's for sure. Did you see the movie Awakenings?
That movie was crazy. It was the first time I really thought maybe drugs can really help people with mental issues.
Really, that's not surprising since you think eating natural foods can cure everything.
Well it doesn't hurt anything. Sad thing is Mrs. Doubtfire is probably his most famous role.
That was a good movie, don't you like it.
Yes, I like it but he was in so many better ones.
