Did you hear about the new remake of A Star is Born with Lady Gaga?
I did not know this! She's going to play the rising star?
Yes, with Bradley Cooper as the falling movie star.
They are going to look mighty fine together.
This a country western remake, so we'll see and hear a different Gaga.
I think she'll do great. She's always reinventing herself.
I saw her do A-Yo live on Saturday Night Live. She was fantastic.
I saw it too. It was kind of a rockin' country song, and she did such a great job.
As an actress, she will be using her given name, Stefani Germanotta. That'll be different too.
I hope it's a blockbuster. I can't wait to see it.
