Have you seen the new Star Wars: Rogue One ?
Yes! It was really good!
It was way better than i expected it to be.
For sure. i like how it shows how everything started to fall once the Empire took control.
Yeah, cause in the originals they talk about how people died getting the plans to the Death Star but nothing else is said about them.
Right, this gave you so much more and bridged the gap on what happened and how the Rebels were able to start really fighting.
Did you see how detailed the CGI was?
Yes! it looked like it was really Grand Moff Tarkin really there and a young Leia.
Plus that last scene with Darth Vader, that made it worth it.
Oh yes! He was the Darth Vader we needed, not being sensitive Anakin Skywalker. He was Darth Vader, and showed why he was so feared across the galaxy.
