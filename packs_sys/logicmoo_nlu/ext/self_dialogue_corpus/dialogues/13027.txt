Here's one thing I find confusing about the Star Wars franchise... well, one of several of things, really, but this is a big one.
Okay, what's that?
The Clone Wars.  I mean, they've got a TWO series that were called The Clone Wars and a full length movie, and it's like, could they not come up with another title?
Wait, they had two series called Clone Wars?
Yeah, one was like a series of five minute shows that aired on Cartoon Network before Revenge of the Sith came out.  They kind of bridged the gap between the last two prequel films.
Oh, yeah, think I remember something about that.
And the other, more well known, was a full half hour series done in computer animated graphics.
Yeah, my nephew used to watch that a lot.
Yeah, but the short one is called Star Wars: Clone Wars, and the longer series is called Star Wars: THE Clone Wars.  I mean, seriously?
Yeah, I don't think they were very creative in the naming scheme there.
