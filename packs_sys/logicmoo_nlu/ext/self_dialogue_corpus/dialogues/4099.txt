Are there any new thriller films coming out that you are excited for?
The Stephen King’s IT remake is a big one for me. That first trailer was great!
I completely agree with you. It definitely looks like it has potential. Have you seen the original TV movie?
I have, yes, a long time ago. Unfortunately, it hasn’t aged well, in my opinion.
I can’t disagree with that, but Tim Curry was still amazing as Pennywise.
Yes, it definitely seemed like he was enjoying himself behind all of that makeup.
What do you think of the new actor and look for the remake?
I think it looks good, for the most part. I have read that they are going to make the film more like the book.
I have heard that, too. That could make the film a huge success.
For sure, and it could also make it more popular for the Stephen King fans.
