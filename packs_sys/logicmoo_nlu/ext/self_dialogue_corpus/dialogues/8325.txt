So, is there anyone in Pop music right now that you are really into?
Oh yeah, there are actually quite a few different artists. But I really like a lot of Drake's new songs.
Oh, cool! I like his new stuff too. Anything that really stands out for you?
Well, I really like "Signs." I just think it is a great song.
I like that song too. Anything else by Drake that you really like?
Oh, yeah, for sure. I really liked his record "What a Time to be Alive."
I know that album pretty well; it was really good! It had "Jumpman" on it, which was a great song.
Yeah, that's right! It was a super popular song a few years ago, and I still think it is one of Drake's best.
Oh, totally. I actually can't wait for some new songs.
Me too! He has a tough job of following his own act, but I can't wait to hear what he has next!
