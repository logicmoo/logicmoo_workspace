Do you like the Star Wars series?
I do but wouldn't say I am a die hard fan. Do you have a favorite character?
C3PO would have to be my favorite.
Why is he your favorite?
Well it's not just him it's his relationship with R2D2 in the first star wars. I just really like how they told it from their persective
Wasn't the first star wars based on the Akari Kurusowa film the hidden fortress.
Yes I have heard that. The fact that both where told from the lowliest of charter ie c3po and r2d2 and in the hidden fortress it was told from the perspective of two pessants
Wow I think that also it was an easy movie to making into sci fi, they replaced the samurai swords with light sabers
With such wild success from the first one they had to make it into a series.
Yeah there would haven't been a second third or seventh without that fist film having so much success.
