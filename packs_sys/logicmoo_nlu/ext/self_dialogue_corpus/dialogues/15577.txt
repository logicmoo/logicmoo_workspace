Hey what song by Jethro Tull do you like?
What album do you want me to pick from?
Aqualung or Passion Play. Either of those would work
I'll give you one on both. Aqualung and Bungle in The Jungle
Nice choices... How about Alan Parsons Project?
The only album I know is Tales of Mystery and Imagination.
Perfect. I have that album and love the songs on there.
Yes I do too. The concept of using Edgar Allen Poe's poetry to make songs was so brilliant
So what song do you like on there?
Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether and The Cask Of Amontillado are both superb
I like those two as well. The Raven is definitely up there at the top.
I really not a huge fan of that type of prague rock but I like that album.
That was probably a way out in left field kind of question but i was looking through our music we have saved on the computer and I saw those two groups.
Yes it's fun to back and look to see what you used to listen to and what you like now.
My tastes haven't changed in what I like.
Mine either it's just determinate on my mood as to what I want to listen too
Sometimes I want to  listen to a bunch of old stuff like Seals and Crofts.
They sound familiar but their music  eludes me at the moment.
Hummingbird or Summer Breeze you may recall. Summer Breeze was #1 in 1972
Yes I do remember those songs.
