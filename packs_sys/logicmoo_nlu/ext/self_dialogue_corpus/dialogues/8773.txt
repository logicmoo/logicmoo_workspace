Do you think the idea of the "rock star" is still relevant?
Well sure, why wouldn't it be?
Well, rock is no longer the genre of youth - most popular rock is classic rock these days.
I suppose that's true. Still, what define a rock star?
I'd define rock star as an iconoclast, in the vein of cobain and osbourne. It's hard to find figures like that in music these days.
Why do you think that is?
Well, the changing music industry is forcing bands to be more self-sufficient and promote themselves.
True, it's hard to imagine drug-addled early Ozzy also serving as his own accountant
Exactly - I think that level of self sufficient responsibility being necessary has stifled music and modern creativity in general
If that's true, yeah, I can see why that would kill off the viability of the "rock star". Too much social responsibility is required nowadays for people to be throwing TVs out of hotel windows.
