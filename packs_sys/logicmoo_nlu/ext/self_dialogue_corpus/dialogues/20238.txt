So what kind of movies do you watch?
All sorts, I love film.
Oh really? So do I. What's your favorite genre?
Probably drama or thriller.
I agree I feel like the acting is better in a drama or thriller for some reason.
Yeah I totally agree. What's your favorite movie?
I'd have to go with, "The Graduate."
I love that movie! Dustin Hoffman is my favorite!
No way me too!
Yeah, I love Midnight Cowboy and Kramer vs. Kramer.
Oh yeah me too, I've never cried so much in a movie then in Kramer vs. Kramer.
Oh man, I know. Meryl Streep is awesome in that too.
Yeah, she is. I heard they didn't get along on set.
Really? That sucks, what happened?
I read he slapped her or something to make her angry on set because he needed her to be angry in a scene..
Wow! that's insane.
I know, maybe a little overboard.
Yeah, you can say that for sure.
I know, I think it's just one of those things actors do to get under their skin, they antagonize them on set.
Yeah, but sometimes you can tell it makes movies better!
