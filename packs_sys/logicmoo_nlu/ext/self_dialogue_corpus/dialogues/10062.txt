You have see this movie called Suburban Commando.
I've never heard of it. What's it about?
Oh it's great. Basically it is Hulk Hogan as an alien assassin being chased by other alien assassins who are also professional wrestlers.
This is starting to sound like a terrible movie.
It is! But it is just so terrible that it happened to be great. They obviously blew their budget on the Hulkster.
Okay, so you are saying it's kind of like Sharknado, in that it's so bad that it's kind of good?
Yeah, I mean just imagine Hulk Hogan in a cheap alien uniform escaping the Undertaker's lasers through a random suburban town.
Oh god, I don't know if I want to see this movie.
It is so worth it though. The entire movie is cheap, the frame rate is even something like three frames per second because they run out of money.
That just sounds despicable.
