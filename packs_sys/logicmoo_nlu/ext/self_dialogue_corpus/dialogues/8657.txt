Hey man, what kind of sub-genres of rock music do you like?
Well, I personally listen to mostly indie rock. I'm not too fond of mainstream bands.
Dude, you sound like such a hipster! What about Aerosmith, and AC/DC?
I appreciate them for what they've done for the genre as a whole, but they're not really my cup of tea.
That's blasphemy man! How can you not like classic bands like that?
Well, I feel like their stuff is too played out. The lyrics and songwriting just don't vibe well with me.
So, you're into softer, more mellow stuff? In my opinion, you're either headbanging, or you're doing it wrong.
That's like, your opinion man. I'm entitled to like whatever bands I want to like.
You have a point there man, but at least give me some recommendations for indie rock bands.
Check out Fleet Foxes dude, their album Helplessness Blues is one of my all-time favorites.
