Hey what did you think about the New Beauty and the Beast that they launched this year?
Hmmmm, there was not a big difference for me. I was actually a bit disappointed.
Why is that?
Well they did not do much to change the story it was pretty much the same. Belle, Gaston, the Beast. There really was not much of a different story line and I found that it was not necessary.
You know what, I feel the same way. I actually still prefer the original Beauty and the Beast to this one. My favorite character was Chip the little tea cup.
Yes he is cute. I think the music from the original Beauty and the Beast was more sophisticated. I was actually disappointed that they redid the original Beauty and the Beast song that was done by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson
Yeah total bummer, that was a big disappointment for me too.
Well at least they kept to the story line.
They did but I think that that is what killed it for me. They should have done a Part 2 and made something totally new instead of trying to do this over.
You're right they really should have.
