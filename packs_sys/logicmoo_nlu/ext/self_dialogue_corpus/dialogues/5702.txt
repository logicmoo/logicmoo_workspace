We were watching a couple Disney movies on dvd at my aunt's house this weekend, and one of them was Moana. My aunt was telling me how this movie made people upset.
It's a Disney movie, what could people be upset about?
Apparently, the character Maui is a big huge guy, and it upset people because they felt it was sterotyping Polynesians as fat.
Well, some of them are really big.
The character isn't meant really to even be so much as fat though, as he is just really big and strong.
But so what if he is fat? Why do people have to look at fat as bad and sterotyping? That's like saying if you are fat, it's bad.
Especially with it being a kid's movie, cause a lot of kids these days are overweight, so it's kind of indirectly shaming them if you say there's something bad about Disney making him so big.
Exactly. And I don't think kids would even see it that way, without adults coloring their persception by pointing it out.
It's like the adults are saying if you are big, you can't just blend in, you are noticable.
It's a shame people have to ruin something innocent like a Disney movie by making a controversy about it.
