I just watched the Fast and the Furious series for the first time.
What did you think of it. I love those movies.
I really liked them. There was one I wasn't thrilled about though.
Which one was that?
I wasn't a big fan of Tokyo Drift.
Really?! That is one of my favorites.
I know, I hear that from a lot of people. I just feel it is kind of thrown in and doesn't really go with the rest of the series.
Ya I guess I can see that. I really like the main character though.
Ya he is ok. The best thing for me out of this movie was the introduction of Han.
Oh ya definitely. He is one of my favorites.
