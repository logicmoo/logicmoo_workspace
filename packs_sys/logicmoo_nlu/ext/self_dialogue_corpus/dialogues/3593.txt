The Rob Zombie movie "House of 1000 Corpses" is quite disturbing.
Yes, I agree, I was a bit freaked out the further along the movie went.
When they pulled into Captain Spaulding's place, I thought he was just a weird, funny guy.
I know, I started freaking out a bit when they rode the Murder Ride, I knew something wasn't right.
Probably when things really got bad was when they dressed the people up as rabbits and put them down that hole in the ground.
Right, that was terrifying and the girl running for her life and coming face to face with that monster Dr. Satan.
You know, that was so bad, he was extra creepy.
The worst part of the whole thing was the end, you know, when she rose out of the ground and that horrible place.
Yes, I truly thought she was safe, and all I could think was "run girl run!".
Of all people to pick her up, Captain Spaulding, well, we both know what happens now, and the movie doesn't even have to continue!
