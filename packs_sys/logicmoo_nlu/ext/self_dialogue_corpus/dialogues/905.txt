What do you think about some of the new rules in the NFL?
I don't really have a problem with much of the new rules. But I do hate how players get penalized for celebrating.
I think some celebrating is okay, but I really hate when players go overboard.
Yeah, but to me, that's what makes the game fun. I like seeing the over the top celebrations from some players.
I don't. Some of these guys act like clowns.
Well, I would figure that scoring a touchdown in the NFL would be exciting.
Yeah, but these players are getting paid good money to do their jobs. They need to act more professional.
I do think some celebrations need to be banned. But for the most part, let these guys have some fun.
I guess one of the problems I have with it is that it takes too much time away from the game.
That's something I can agree with you on. If a celebration stalls the game too much, then it should be penalized.
Other than celebrations, you don't have a problem with the other rules?
No, not really. What new rules do you not like?
I was never a fan of kickoffs being done so far into the field. It pretty much eliminates most returns.
I do agree with that. But I think they did that because too many people were getting hurt from kickoff returns.
But that's part of the game. To me, if it's exciting, I want to watch it.
I don't know. I would rather players stay healthy so I can watch them actually play.
But kickoffs are part of the game. The NFL has already been too soft with so many of the things that used to be legal in the sport.
Yeah, it is frustrating to watch some of the rules that prevent defensive players to play like defensive players.
Exactly. I want to watch a sport where football players have the freedom to play.
So more violence is acceptable to you, but celebrations are over the top? Okay.
