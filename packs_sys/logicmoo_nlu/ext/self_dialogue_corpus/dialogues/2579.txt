How do you think the Lions will do this season?
I think they might make the playoffs but only if the key players stay healthy.
That's a big if - they already lost their best offensive lineman in practice.
You're talking about the left tackle, right?  He'll be back at some point and I think they got someone decent to fill in.
I'm not sure about that.  Left tackle is a key position because it protects the quarterback's blind side.
That's true enough.  And Matthew Stafford has taken his share of hits over the years.
Speaking of Stafford, with Calvin Johnson retired he really needs to spread the ball around more.
The big missing element is a consistent running game to compliment that passing game.
Last year their best running back missed most of the season and the running game was mediocre at best.
I agree.  And the problem with that is that other teams can focus on stopping that passing game rather than worry about both.
Abudullah is their best runner and he's coming back this season and looking good so far.
Trouble is that he's prone to injury although when he's healthy he is a real threat.
What about the other side of the ball - how's is the defense looking?
They need to develop a consistent pass rush to be effective.
That's true.  Their defensive ends were missing in action last year.
Yeah, I don't know what happened with Ziggy Ansah but he was a disappointment last year.
The secondary has improved over the last couple years but never can get the job done against the best quarterbacks like Tom Brady.
That's why the pass rush is so important because it helps the defensive backs when the quarterback is under pressure.
Well if they can pull all the elements together they have a good shot at the playoffs with the schedule they have.
And once you're in the playoffs you're only a few wins away from the Super Bowl, which would be a first for the Lions.
