Have you seen the new 'Clash of the Titans" movie?
Yes, it was kinda strange.
Strange? How?
When compared to the older , original version, it just lacks something.
Really, how so, like in plot or visually?
Visually the new version is beautiful to watch, has some cool effects as far as the CG went, but it just lacked the granduer  of the original for me.
I can see that. The original made one feel like it was truely a trial and journey, the new one just felt like a story unfolding.
For me, the original felt like it engaged the audience more.
Do you think it was more a casting choice issue?
maybe, I mean the cast did a good job, just not a dazzling one.
What do you mean?
For example, when he goes to kill Medusa, in the original, the fear of getting turned to stone looked real in his eyes, like he embraced the role.
I thought so too. In the new one, it was just like, oh well one of my guys is a statue not, no big deal.
Also, when the statue of Athena came to life, in the new one it was just a stiff delivery. The original , despite the effects, made it feel like her spirit had overtaken an inatimate object.
I agree, an this is where i think that the lack of cg actually made the scene better.
The kracken in the new version was epic!
I agree, visually more explosive. The original looked more like king Kong and swamp thing had a baby.
hahaha that would be awesome.
What did you like aboput Posiden?
I liked him better in the Newer version, and it expalined his role better in the plot.
