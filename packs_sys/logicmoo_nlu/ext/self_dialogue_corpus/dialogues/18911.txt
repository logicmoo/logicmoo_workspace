What type of music have you been listening to lately?
I found my old ipod and started listening to my old songs.  Some of them I had even forgotten.
Did you find any good surprises?
Quite a few.  It's interesting how one's musical interests can change throughout the years.
But hearing an old song is like hearing an old friend.
Have you ever cried when listening to a song?
Yes, but mainly because it reminded me of someone or something.
What about being happy when hearing a song.
Absolutely.  Some songs just make you move.
I like funk when I'm feeling down.  I think it's hard to be down when listening to funk music.
It's amazing that music is so evocative.
I usually have songs that remind me of certain places and trips.
I do that too!  Often, there is a theme song that I hear a lot when planning the trip and when I actually travel.
Like what?
Most recently, it was the main song from "La la land" and Paris.
When did you hear it in Paris?
We were having lunch at a fancy hotel and the piano player in the lobby started playing it.
The other song from Paris that we heard a lot was Gymnopedie from Eric Satie.
I like that song as well.  But only when it is played slowly.
It is very French.
