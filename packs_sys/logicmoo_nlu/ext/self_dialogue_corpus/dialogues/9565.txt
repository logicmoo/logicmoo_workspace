Have you been watching the new Fear Factor? I can't believe it's being hosted by Ludacris.
Ludacris the rapper?? Why would he be hosting a TV show??
Lots of rappers are into acting nowadays.
I guess once their rapping career fails they move into acting, if they get the opportunity.
Maybe you're right, because he hasn't had a big hit since maybe 2009 or 2010 when he sang My Chick Bad
Let's be honest though, that song only was a hit because he did it with Nicki Minaj.
True, people really love her. I know I do.
I think they were great together. I was hoping they'd do more tracks together.
And be like the new Jah Rule and Ashanti?
Nah, I was more thinking like Fat Joe and Remy Ma. They're both rappers. Ashanti isn't a rapper!
