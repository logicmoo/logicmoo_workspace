Are you a fan of Sofia Coppola's movies?
I've seen Lost in Translation and Marie Antoinette. I thought they were good.
Well she's got a new movie out called 'The Beguiled' that I'm dying to see.
Wasn't there a movie with Clint Eastwood from the '70s with that same name?
Yes, it's a story based on a book. It takes place in the deep south, so the original movie comes with a heavy dose of patriarchy.
One thing  I know about Sofia's movies is that they focus on the female experience. Is that the case in this film?
Absolutely. She has a great cast of women including Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst, and Elle Fanning, among others, who are all pitted against Colin Farrell's character.
When does it take place?
During the civil war. However, sadly this movie doesn't incorporate contemporary music the way her other films do.
Oh, that's a bummer. I remember that being one of my favorite aspects of Marie Antoinette.
Me too. I'm still excited to see this. She just won the Best Director category at Cannes this year for the film.
I guess it must be a great movie, since I think only one other woman has won that category before. It's quite competitive.
Absolutely. I think it is indicative of her ability to convey such an interesting and thrilling story from a different perspective. I'm excited for the costumes and general aesthetic of the film.
Sofia Coppola and gothic southern style - I never thought i'd hear those two in the same sentence!
She even filmed in the same plantation house as Beyonce's Lemonade!
Do you think it was intentional?
Apparently she had no idea. She only found out when some of the younger girls working on her film were freaking out over it.
You've got me excited to see the film now. When is it out in theaters?
Last week of June, I think. Sofia herself said it's best to see it in theaters as it's a good collective experience.
Count me in!
