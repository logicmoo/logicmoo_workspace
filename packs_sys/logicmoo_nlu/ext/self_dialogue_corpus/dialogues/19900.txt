Sounds great. Reminds me, did you hear any of Childish Gambino's new stuff?

Definitely redbone. It's got such a good groove to it.
I agree. What's the name of Chance's newest album?
It's called Coloring Book.
What's your favorite song on that album.
It's hard to pick, there's a couple that are really good.
Well then, which one have you listened to the most?
Same Drugs. It's a great song, lots of heart/
What's that song about?
Not drugs. It's actually about him and a childhood girlfriend.
Oh, like a love song?
Not really, more about growing apart, but it's a good listen.
