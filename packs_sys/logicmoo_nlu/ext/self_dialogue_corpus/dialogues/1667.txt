Hey are you a big fan of football?
Yes I am, but it is hard being a fan of my team!
What team is that?
The Vikings! They always get so close and then choke in the playoffs!
Wow that is harsh, I remember they started off strong last year and fell off. At least your team is hosting the Super Bowl this year!
Yea that is nice, I sure hope the Vikings are in the Superbowl as well though. What is your favorite team?
I am actually a huge cheesehead and love the Packers!
Oh no our favorite teams are rivals! But I respect how well your organization is run.
Thanks for that, I hate it when people take their fandom too seriously.
I agree it really ruins the fun of sports.
We also both got to enjoy the greatness that is Brett Favre!
Yea his two years here were the most fun I have had watching the Vikings since the Randy Moss years!
It was weird watching him play and beat the Packers up but I agree it was amazing to see him have such great seasons at the twilight of his career.
Weird? Don't you mean great! Haha at least we aren't Patriots fans right?
Oh man you can say that again. Remember how great the 2007 season was when they lost in the Super Bowl?
I do! That was such an amazing game. They are such a good team and I respect them but I can't help but root for them to lose.
Exactly! I can't believe the Giants beat them. What was your favorite part of the game?
It was easily David Tyree's leaping one-handed catch. That was amazing!
I remember standing up and cheering in the bar I was at when that play happened! Wow Eli Manning had a great game in that Super Bowl!
Yea he is a pretty good quarterback, but I think we both agree he isn't as good as the legend Brett Favre!
