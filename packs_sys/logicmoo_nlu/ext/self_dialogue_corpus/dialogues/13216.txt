What do you think will happen in the new Star Wars movie, the Last Jedi?
I don't know, but I'm happy to see Luke Skywalker back in action. I think they'll kill Leia off screen as a result of Carrie Fisher's death too.
Did you like Rogue One?
I did, I really enjoyed seeing a story not focus on the Jedi and instead on the more regular people. It felt like a war movie.
Who is your favorite character in the Star Wars Universe?
I really like Han Solo. Harrison Ford is a good actor and Solo has those rogueish qualities that I really like.
What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
I think it has to be Empire Strikes Back. It's one of the more focused and dramatic stories, and the Darth Vader scenes are fantastic and full of suspense.
Do you enjoy the Star Wars prequels?
I think there are some things that the movies do well, but that the dialogue and story aren't good enough to watch as an adult.
