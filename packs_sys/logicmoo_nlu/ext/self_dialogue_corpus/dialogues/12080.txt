Do you think Princess Leia will be in the Last Jedi movie?
Good question. I'd be surprised since she passed away but I would love to see her included in the cast somehow. Her story feels unfinished.
yes. Especially after they killed off  Han Solo and her son Kylo Ren joined the dark side.
Yes, it feels like her story as Ren's mother and Han Solo's widow hasn't been told yet.
Maybe the'll use CGI to bring her back to life for a few scenes in the movie.
It would be wonderful if they did that. I really want to know more about her relationship with Kylo Ren and see them interact.
Another thing I would love to see is more of Rey's background. I wonder if her parents are really the ones we saw die in the movie.
There really is no reason why they wouldn't be her parents. She doesn't have to be related to Luke or Leia to posses the power of the force, does she?
I guess not. Thats a good point. Everyone wants to believe she is Luke Skywalker's daughter. But I guess that might be another movie?
Now that's a movie I'd like to see. Maybe they can fill in the gap in the timeline in future star wars movies. Either way I am already looking forward to the Last Jedi.
