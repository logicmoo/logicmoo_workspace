Have you seen a movie called Chronicle? It's a superhero movie but it's not typical.
Yes I've seen it and I love it. I loved the build up of their powers and how much chemistry the guys had together.
What was your favorite part of the movie?
It would have to be when they were joking around at the store, scaring people and moving cars.
Yes that was hilarious. My favorite part was when the did the magic show and no one had a clue they were doing real magic.
Oh yes that was classic. That's something I would have totally done if I were them.
The scene where all three of the guys were flying was pretty cool too, until they were knocked out of the sky by an airplane.
I would have been scared to death being up there in the first place!
You're right, they were definitely brave. The character Andrew was destined to become a villain. You could see that early.
Yes and I felt so bad for him though. He'd been through a lot and was still going through it. I doubt he would have turned evil had he not been mistreated so.
