Have you heard of that kid who sang Three Little Birds?
You mean that Bob Marley song?
Yes, this little girl sang the song when she was like four and her voice is so sweet.
I'm not really into kids singing, but I like that song when Bob Marley sings it.
I think you might like the kid's version, though. It has the same beat and rhythm to it.
Maybe, but I doubt she sounds as good as Bob Marley.
Do you want a link to the song? I really think you would like it even if you don't like kid music. It isn't like a silly kid's song or anything.
Sure, I'll listen to it.  You're making me want to listen to Bob Marley now, though.
I always think it is cool when I hear kids with a lot of talent doing covers on famous music.  Some of them sound strange, but mostly they are just so amazing.
I agree that there is a lot of talent. I just prefer to listen to music without the "cute" factor involved.
I'm going to put on some reggae now. Talking about Bob Marley made me want to listen.  I think you're right in a way. The little girl doesn't really have that sound.
I'm sure she has a great voice. I just always think of them as kind of like little puppets when they sing other peoples' songs.
Like a parrot? They don't really understand what they're singing about?
Yes, because how can a six year old have a clue about all the emotion that is behind a song an artist writes and sings?
That is a good point. The Three Little Birds song is pretty simple, though. So I think Connie Talbot really nails it in her own interpretation.
That's just it though. It's not really her interpretation. It is something created by the adults around her to give the illusion of it being hers.
Whatever, I guess. I just really think she sounds sweet. Anyway, she's not a little girl anymore.
Do you want me to send you some reggae tunes? I have a lot of music in my library.
That would be great, thanks!
Okay, it'll be just a minute.
