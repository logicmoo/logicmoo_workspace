Have you seen all of the Harry Potter films?
I've seen all except the Deathly Hallows.
So you don't know what happens to Voldemort at the end of the series?
I'm pretty sure Harry Potter wins, but I don't know for sure.
Who do you think that Harry Potter ends up marrying after leaving Hogwarts?
I'm guessing Ginny Weasley, but I'm not sure.
Well, without giving anything away, a lot of people get killed in the Deathly Hallows. Whose death would you hate the most?
I would definitely hate it if Hagrid were to die.
Do you think Snape will turn out to be good or bad?
I definitely think that Snape is evil. However, I hope he redeems himself in the last movie.
