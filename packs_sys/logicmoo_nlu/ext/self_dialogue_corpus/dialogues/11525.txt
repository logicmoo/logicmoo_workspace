Would you rate the Beatles as the greatest rock band of all time?
Probably.  One could make that argument based upon the sheer volume of their work, its success in the market and how they remain relevant today.
Yes, and they produced such a variety of music, too.
Definitely.  One of their great talents was how varied their music could be.
John and Paul were fortunate to have each other.  I think the music they produced when together was much better than what they did as solo artists.
Yes, I agree.  Some of Paul's music after the Beatles was downright sappy.
Yes, the Silly Little Love song crap versus great songs like All My Loving, Here, There and Everywhere, For No One, Blackbird to name a few.  He was downright prolific in that short time.
Yes, and John, too.  Songs like A Day in Life, Girl, In My Life, No Reply to name a few.
Yes, and let's not forget George.  He was more of a late bloomer, but Something and Here Comes the Sun are masterpieces.
Yes, and when the Beatles broke up he seemed to have the best unreleased catalogue at the time given the All Things Must Pass album.
