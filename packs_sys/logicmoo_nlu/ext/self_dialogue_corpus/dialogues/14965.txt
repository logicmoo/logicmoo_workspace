What do you think is funny the hangover or bridesmaids?
Hangover is my favorite of all time.
I liked hangover and hangover part 2, but thought overall bridesmaids may have been better.
No way. I think bridesmaids was great don't get me wrong. But Hangover had so many great moments.
Zach Galifianakis does shine in hangover. I did like the plot of the first one. The sequel I did not enjoy as much.
I enjoyed them both. I think they did a great job a lot of sequels bomb badly or can't live up to the first. I think the second is just as good.
It is a matter of opinion I guess, I still says bridesmaid is funnier than both hangovers.
Melissa mccartney stood out to me in bridesmaids.
She is really funny in it, my favorite is when she is on the plane and lifts her leg.
That is a great moment. I was surprised she could get her leg up so high. She has lost a lot of weight since then, typical of hollywood.
