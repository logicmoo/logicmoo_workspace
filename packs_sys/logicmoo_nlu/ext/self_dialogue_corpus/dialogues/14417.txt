I am having withdrawals since the NCAA tournament wrapped up.
No kidding. College basketball is the best. Especially ACC!
Did you see that Grayson Allen is coming back for his senior year?
Yes, what a jerk. I'm sure no NBA team would touch that cheater baby.
He definitely needs to mature. UVA lost some of their guys that weren't getting enough play.
Tony's pack line defense is a thing of beauty, but it's not for everyone.
Have you ever been to a game at JPJ?  What a great venue.
I went to the Virginia Tech game last year.
Don't you love Buzz?
For sure. He has turned Tech's program around. Have you ever been to Cassell?
I haven't. Too far to drive down and back for a game. Evan goes to the games when he remembers to get tickets.
Sweet. It looks so small compared to JPJ.
Are there any other teams you follow?
Sure. I follow Mason and VCU.  I was really bummed when Shaka went to Texas. He was such a great coach.
We did go to Richmond to see a VCU vs. Mason game. VCU's fans are rabid.
No kidding. I know just what you mean. Loved seeing him coach.
I follow Iowa State too. Monty Morris graduated this year so not sure what their team will look like next year.
They'll need some Hylton Magic for sure.
Ready for football? We've got our tickets for the VT/WVU game in September.
That will be a great game. Looking forward to seeing them play at Fed Ex Field. Go Hokies!
