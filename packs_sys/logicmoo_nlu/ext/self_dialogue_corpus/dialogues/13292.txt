I don't think the Empire is really the bad guys in Star Wars. What do you think?
What do you mean?
Well, really if you think about it. The jedis are really the bad guys.
Why would you say that?
The main reason is that they will take a child that they think is strong with the force and make them become a jedi.
Eeeek, I never thought about that. That is kind of messed up but that still doesn't make the Empire good guys.
It does if the Empire is trying to stop what the jedis are doing.
Hmmm, but what about the Sith? Aren't they bad?
Well, Darth Vader was a Sith. He was just reuniting his family and following his beliefs.
Can't blame a guy for doing that.
