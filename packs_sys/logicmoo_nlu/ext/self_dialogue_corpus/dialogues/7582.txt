Are you a fan of Harry Potter movies?
Oh yes, I absolutely love those movies. I've read all of the books as well.
I haven't had a chance to read them all yet. Is the movie following the story line given in the books well?
More or less, even though there are some differences, and the book offers more details about the characters.
Which of the characters is your favorite?
My favorite is Hermione for sure. And Emma Watson does such an excellent job portraying her.
She is probably my favorite too, even though I love the character of Snape as well.
He's a very complex character for sure. It's interesting once you really get to learn a character's back story.
Yeah it can change your whole perception of the character. That definitely happened with Snape.
Yes, the flash back scenes from his past revealed a lot about what kind of a man he actually was and explained a lot of his actions.
