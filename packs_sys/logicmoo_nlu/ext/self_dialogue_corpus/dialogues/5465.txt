Did you get to see the new Disney movie "Cars 3" that came out this year?
I totally did I thought it was awesome!
So did I. I love the message that is was sending about having a strong sens of community and also that winning is not everything if it is at the expense of someone else's well being.
Totally! It really honed in on the whole deal of moral values. We sure need a big dose of that these days.
Indeed. These are the kids of messages I think that really need to be instilled in our kids.
Hey I'm a big kid too (chuckles) but you're absolutely right. That's why I'll take a Disney Movie any day.
I loved how they showed that sometimes you really have to loose to win.
Yeah and sometimes based on what you do to win you end up being a Looser!!
They really stressed the need and the value in a strong sense of community which I think is lacking today, in a world that is so self oriented.
Totally, we need each other and it is when we have a sense of community we could build something awesome. Yay Cars!!
