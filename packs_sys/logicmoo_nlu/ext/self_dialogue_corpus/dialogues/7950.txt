Yeah it's cool so why the questions about that song it's been out for a while now.
I know i just want to have something to talk about for awhile and since i love music i figured i would see what Pop songs you like too.
Did you see her video it was really cool she had all these dancers rump shaking their butts.
Yes the dancers where great and looked really nice in those ballet outfits.
Oh there's another song that caught me by Taylor and it really had my spirits up about men. Can you guess which hit song it was?
I Guess i know which one you are going to say was it blank space? I was really big on this one.
Yes your guess was right it was blank space she really hit the tops with that song. and the video was really cool too.
The records she comes out with can really make you feel her songs they make you think and make you dance.
