Hey! What's your favorite movie?
I'd have to say Terminator 2, have you seen it?
No, I've only seen the new ones. Is it good?
It's, in my opinion, the best Terminator. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Edward Furlong, Linda Hamilton and Robert Patrick.
Those are big actors! What's the general plot?
Well you've probably have the basics of Terminator but it's basically a good terminator protecting John and Sarah Connor from the T-1000.
Arnold is a good terminator?
Yeah, future John Connor sent a terminator to the past (where the movie takes place) to protect John from the T-1000.
That's cool, when did it come out?
It came out on July 3rd, 1991.
That's pretty dated. Does it have bad CGI or anything like that?
Actually it really doesn't. The movie concept and the graphics are pretty ahead of it's done. Also the soundtrack and theme of Terminator 2 is amazing.
What's in the beginning?
It's the opening theme that shows the war between man and machine with Sarah Connor talking over it. Then it goes into a post apocalyptic LA with a ton of symbolism, it's powerful.
Woah, that sounds awesome!
Yeah! There's also a bunch of crazy things that occurred behind the scenes of the movie as well.
Oh really, like what?
Well, one of the things that happened, was Linda Hamilton had permanent hearing loss in one ear from the famous elevator scene because her ears were not covered or plugged up.
I have to check this movie out like right now!
You really should, it's a classic and great movie!
