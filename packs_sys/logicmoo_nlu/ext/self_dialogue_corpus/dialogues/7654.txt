Why can't I find a badly scribbled over textbook that contains all the answers I need for school like in Harry Potter.
Exactly! I think we'd end up squabbling quickly over it just like Harry and Ron do in Half-Blood Prince.
Nah, we'd end up sharing it. What I love is how much Hermione fumes over the scribbles being more spot on compared to the instructions in the book.
Oh, totally, Emma Watson did that so well. I think most people that love Hermione's character had to love how that played out in the movie.
True, I burst out laughing when the students are working on their potions and Hermione's hair has gone from curly to crazy thanks to the fumes.
That was perfect! Also, her scene in Potions where she lets it slip what she smells when she smells the love potion Amortentia.
Yes! Awkward teen moment there; some of it is just loving Hermione's character throughout the movies but some of it is that I think Slughorn's Potions class would have actually been fun.
Dangerous but fun, it seemed like everything was free to explode or catch fire. The movie is pretty intense for the series so it was like a bit of relief from all the tension.
Yep, until Harry gets his assignment from Dumbledore to ask about the Horcruxes. Not to mention Ron accidentally overdosing on a badly mixed love potion which was fairly funny and then turning around and getting accidentally poisoned.
I know, poor Ron! He's definitely put through the ringer in Half-Blood Prince with the poisoning, Quidditch, and all the drama between him and Hermione.
