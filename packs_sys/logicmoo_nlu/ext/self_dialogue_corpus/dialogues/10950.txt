Next Tuesday night, you going?
You know it! I wouldn't miss it for anything.
Yes, me too. I might have to move a few thing around but i'll be there.
What did you think about that new goalie tonight?
Who, Bradshaw?
Yeah.
Hmm, not bad. That one stop was amazing though.
Yeah, that was unbelievable right? I still don't even know how he blocked that puck.
It really gives me hope for the season though.
Yeah, me too. I wasn't so sure about him until that moment. But now...
Exactly! Can't wait for Tuesday and see what other tricks he's got up his sleeve.
How many more games are left this season anyway?
Um, seven I think. No eight, yeah eight games.
Hopefully Morgan will be back soon. Can't believe that ankle injury is taking so long to heal.
I know right. We could really use him against the Sabers in three weeks.
No kidding, right, he's our best scorer. Hopefully he'll be back before that game.
You renewing your season tickets this year?
Without a doubt, win or lose, i'm a fan for life.
Me too!
See you next game!
