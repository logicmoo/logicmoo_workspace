So what do you think about M.I.A.?
She's pretty awesome, at least musically. I've not followed her closely, though.
Yeah, somehow this had gone under my radar until the other day. Now I keep playing that first album over and over.
Arular? Yeah, that's a great one. She really came out of the gate strong.
Got to admit I don't really understand all of the content, but it seems... revolutionary.
Yeah, that's a big part of her music. It's all political, social activism.
It is... but, it's also really flippant and playful about it.
There's a line somewhere, that I love, that goes... paraphrased, probably, but: "Gonna get squeaky so you can come and oil me." It's kind of hilarious.
Yeah, the use of words is interesting. That's part of what makes it sometimes hard to understand, though -- some of the things she says, are these terms I should know?
I'm sure part of it is cultural. Still not quite sure what "Bucky" refers to, and I've not gone to the trouble of looking it up.
I'm -- look, I don't actually know what most of this is about, but it sounds like she's pushing back against an occupying power. Is this about Palestine?
That's very likely. Though at the same time, you'll see her posing in Sonic the Hedgehog T-shirts.
Anything that seems like it's making a statement, it seems clouded by the way she expresses it -- sometimes the jargon or slang she uses, and sometimes just through onomatopoeia.
She does go for the bangs and the booms, doesn't she.
And other things -- like, what's Galang? Is that another sound effect, or does it actually mean something?
Reminds me of the Law & Order noise. GALANG.
Didn't Mike Post file a music copyright for that, so he gets paid every time it's used?
Did he? That's... clever of him.
It's like the BBC and the TARDIS noise. It's categorized as a musical cue, for copyright purposes.
I'm... is there anything that would be disqualified for a music copyright?
