Hey have you seen The original release of Star Wars Episode 4?
Which version?
The one where Han shot first.
Oh you mean the original release before George Lucas Added all the extra computer graphics?
Yes.  I really miss the original version.  I feel it made the star wars universe more believable.
Yeah I really love that part where Luke gets a kiss from Leia on the cheek for luck.
I always thought that was weird because they were brother and sister.
What's really weird is when ObiWan denies ever owning a R2 unit.
Yeah once you watch the prequels, you realize what a liar ObiWan was.  He doesn't seem like the most moral Jedi.
The jedi were never really about morality.  If they were moral they wouldn't use the Jedi Mind tricks to lie and manipulate people to get what they want.
