If you had to choose, what would be the best movie death of all time?
Wow, that's a big question. I think it would have to be Sean Bean in "Fellowship of the Ring."
Oh yeah! That was amazing.
Such a noble death. And that line: "My brother, my captain, my king." It gets me every time.
The one I really like is Samuel L. Jackson in "Deep Blue Sea."
Oh wow, yeah. Not in the same vein but that was an awesome scene.
It's the last thing you'd ever expect. That's why I like it.
It really did shock me utterly. You never saw it coming.
If you want emotional, though, there will always be Mufasa in "The Lion King."
That one still makes me cry. First, it's James Earl Jones, which makes it tough.
Exactly. He's not one we're used to seeing die, even in animation.
Then Simba's reaction and how Scar makes him feel guilty. It's heartbreaking.
Poor little guy! It's all so very Shakespearean.
That's true. It reminds me of "Hamlet."
It's essentially the same the story, though in "Hamlet" you don't get to witness his father's death.
Disney is good about breaking our hearts watching baby animals lose their parents.
One word: "Dumbo."
Oh forget it. "Dumbo" gets me every time. Even though you know it turns out okay.
Same here. I can't watch the scene where he visits his mother in her trailer without tears rolling down.
If you could, you'd have no soul.
