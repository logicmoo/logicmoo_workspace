Hey, do you listen to metal?
Yeah, a fair bit. Why?
I'm looking to get into it, but I don't know where to start. There are so many genres!
Well, you could always start with the big four of thrash. They were my gateway into metal.
The Big Four?
Yeah, Megadeth, Metallica, Anthrax, and Slayer. My personal favorite is Megadeth, but many people like Metallica. They're kind of like beginner's metal.
Yeah, don't they get played on classic rock radio nowadays?
Yeah they do, but I'd recommend their albums from the '80s. They were pretty heavy and technical back then.
Ok, I'll check them out. What else do you like?
Lately, I've been listening to a lot of progressive metal, like Symphony X and Dream Theater.
