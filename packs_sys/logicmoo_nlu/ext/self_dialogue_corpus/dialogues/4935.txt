Have you heard about the doping scandal in baseball recently?
No, I haven't. What doping scandal?
They're saying that some 20 baseball players may face suspension!
Twenty? That's just crazy! What players are involved?
The report didn't mention all the names but they said that Alex Rodriguez and Ryan Braun are involved in the scandal.
So, what are they doing about it?
Well, the players union said that players are being interviewed by baseball officials and are represented by attorneys.
This could become the worst drug-abuse scandal in the history of U.S. sports!
Tell me about it. The league declined to comment to CNN but confirmed that an investigation is in the works.
I heard that Rodriguez admitted to using banned substances when he played with the Texas Rangers in the early 2000s.
But he denied using performance-enhancing drugs this time.
Do you think he's telling the truth?
It's hard to say. Nowadays, many athletes turn to these kinds of drugs to improve their game.
For his sake, I hope he's telling the truth.
It would be a shame to lose a good player like him.
What do you think will happen if they are found guilty?
They mentioned that the league may ban the players for 100 games.
Seriously? That's a bit much. Don't you think?
Well, they're counting the doping as one fraction and lying about having taken the drugs as a second one.
Oh, I see. I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens.
