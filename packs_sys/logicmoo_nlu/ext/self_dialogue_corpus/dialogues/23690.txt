I got a tough question for you.  Which is your favorite James Bond movie?
Wow, that is a tough question.  There's more than twenty of them!
Ok, I will narrow this down a bit then.  Who is your favorite James Bond actor?
You will think this is odd.  Roger Moore.
Oh really?  Most people say Connery.
Connery was terrific no doubt.  But I really liked Moore.  His James Bond movies were the ones I watched when I was young.
Well that is fair.  James Bond has been around so long I think a lot of people identify with the ones they watched growing up.
Exactly.  I know a lot of younger people choose Brosnan or Craig.
So is it fair to say a Roger Moore Bond movie is your favorite?
I think so.  I'd pick For Your Eyes Only.
Oh yes, that was a good one.
Yea.  It was kind of smaller scale, they kept the cheesy humor and ridiculous action to a minimum.
I know, I really liked that.  It was just a tight well done Bond movie.
Yes.  So what about you.  Who is your favorite Bond and which is your favorite movie?
Ok, honestly I like the newer Bond movies the most.  The Daniel Craig series.
Nothing wrong with that.  So which one is your favorite?
The first Craig Bond movie.  Casino Royale.
Oh, of course!  Terrific movie.
Would you say it could be the best Bond movie of all time?
No, I wouldn't go that far.  It's one of the best, but I can't say any single Bond movie is the absolute best.
