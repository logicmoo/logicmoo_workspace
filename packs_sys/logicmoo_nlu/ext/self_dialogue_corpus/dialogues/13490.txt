Would you ever want to see a movie about what went on between Empire and Jedi?
Without a doubt, clearly a lot went on with Luke, and Leia, and everyone for that matter.
Besides just the healing of Luke.  Leia seemed to suddenly know a lot about Luke's powers for someone who hadn't seen them in previous movies.
And Luke seemed to have much better control over them than he had at the end of Empire.
All the Skywalker's are like that.  They have enormous power.
On that subject, I wonder how much Leia learned in the years between Jedi and the Force Awakens.
Yes, when Han died she clearly understood the force and knew how to use it.  I wonder if she carries a light saber.
That would be great if she did.  I want to see her fight.
It's sad that Carrie Fisher died, I hope they gave her a good sendoff in The Last Jedi.
I bet they did.  It is sad but her last movie is in her greatest and most well known role.
