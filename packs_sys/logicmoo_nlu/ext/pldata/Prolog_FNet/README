This folder contains an SWI-Prolog version of the Berkeley FrameNet database v. 1.4, which was distributed in the SemEval 10 shared task on "Linking events and their participants"

- The file "valence_patterns" lists for every lexical unit in a frame the valence patterns ecoded in the FrameNet database, including the coreness status and the GF/PT label for each frame element as well as the pattern occurrencies in the database.

Every entry has the following structure:

fsr('Lexical_unit'-Lu_pos,Lowercased_frame,[List_of_valence_patterns]).

The list of valence patterns includes in turn every valence pattern for the given LU represented as a list of FEs plus the number of occurrences of that pattern in the FN database.
Every FE label is followed by -c(ore), -p(eripheral) or -e(xtra thematic) and comes also with the phrase type and the grammatical function assigned by FN annotators. 
If a FE is annotated as a target (ex. the "Artist" Frame Element in "Behind_the_scenes" frame), it is represented in the pattern as bearing the "target" PT and GF, for example: [artist-c,target,target].
If a FE has been annotated as null instantiated, it bears the cni/ini/dni label as PT and the "null" label as GF, for example: [ground-c,dni,null].
All other GF and PT labels are those reported in the FN database.

If the valence pattern list is empty, it means that no example sentences were available in the FN database.

- The file "semtypes" contains the list of semantic types associated to every frame element as Prolog "semtype" predicates.
The format is:
semtype(Frame_name, Frame_element, Semantic_type).

(For more information about FN semantic types, please refer to the project documentation).

- The file "frame_to_frame" contains the list of all frame-to-frame relations represented as "frel" Prolog predicates.
The format is:
frel(Relation_type, Frame1, Frame2).

- The file "fe_to_fe" contains the list of all frame element pairs that are put into relation through a frame-to-frame relation. This information is represented as "frels" Prolog predicates.
The format is:
frels(Relation_type, Frame1, Frame2, FE_frame1, FE_frame2).

Note that all data have been extracted from the version of FrameNet 1.4 distributed during the SemEval task, which is officially under development. 
Some information have been added w.r.t the last Berkeley FN release (v. 1.3).

All data have been automatically extracted from the FN database without any manual control. If you note any inconsistencies, please report them to satonelli@fbk.eu or delmont@unive.it.
