<p><a id="sec:mqi-overview"></a>

<p>The SWI Prolog Machine Query Interface ('MQI') is designed to enable 
embedding SWI Prolog into just about any programming language (Python, 
Go, C#, etc) in a straightforward way. It is designed for scenarios that 
need to use SWI Prolog as a local implementation detail of another 
language. Think of it as running SWI Prolog "like a library". It can 
support any programming language that can launch processes, read their 
STDOUT pipe, and send and receive JSON over TCP/IP. A Python 3 library 
is included as a part of SWI Prolog, see Installation Steps for Python (<a class="sec" href="#sec:1.1">section 
1.1</a>).

<p>Key features of the MQI:

<p>
<ul class="latex">
<li>Simulates the familiar Prolog "top level" (i.e. the interactive 
prompt you get when running Prolog: "<code>?-</code>").
<li>Always runs queries from a connection on a consistent, single thread 
for that connection. The application itself can still be multi-threaded 
by running queries that use the multi-threading Prolog predicates or by 
opening more than one connection.
<li>Runs as a separate dedicated <b>local</b> Prolog process to simplify 
integration (vs. using the C-level SWI Prolog interface). The process is 
launched and managed by a specific running client (e.g. Python or other 
language) program.
<li>Communicates using sockets and <a class="url" href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a> 
encoded as UTF-8 to allow it to work on any platform supported by SWI 
Prolog. For security reasons, only listens on TCP/IP localhost or Unix 
Domain Sockets and requires (or generates depending on the options) a 
password to open a connection.
<li>Has a lightweight text-based message format with only 6 commands: 
run synchronous query, run asynchronous query, retrieve asynchronous 
results, cancel asynchronous query, close connection and terminate the 
session.
<li>Communicates answers using <a class="url" href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a>, 
a well-known data format supported by most languages natively or with 
generally available libraries.
</ul>

<p>The server can be used in two different modes:

<p>
<ul class="latex">
<li><b>Embedded mode</b>: This is the main use case for the MQI. The 
user uses a library (just like any other library in their language of 
choice). That library integrates the MQI by launching the SWI Prolog 
process, connecting to it, and wrapping the MQI protocol with a language 
specific interface.
<li><b>Standalone mode</b>: The user still uses a library as above, but 
launches SWI Prolog independently of the language. The client language 
library connects to that process. This allows the user to see, interact 
with, and debug the Prolog process while the library interacts with it.
</ul>

<p>Note that the MQI is related to the [Pengines 
library](pengine-references), but where the Pengines library is focused 
on a client/server, multi-tenet, sandboxed environment, the MQI is 
local, single tenet and unconstrained. Thus, when the requirement is to 
embed Prolog within another programming language "like a library", it 
can be a good solution for exposing the full power of Prolog with low 
integration overhead.

<p><h3 id="sec:mqi-python-installation"><a id="sec:1.1"><span class="sec-nr">1.1</span> <span class="sec-title">Installation 
Steps for Python</span></a></h3>

<p><a id="sec:mqi-python-installation"></a>

<p>A Python 3.x library that integrates Python with SWI Prolog using the 
Machine Query Interface is included within the <code>libs</code> 
directory of the SWI Prolog installation. It is also available using <code>pip install swiplserver</code>. 
See the <a class="url" href="https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/swiplserver/swiplserver/prologserver.html">Python 
swiplserver library documentation</a> for more information on how to use 
and install it from either location.

<p><h3 id="sec:mqi-language-installation"><a id="sec:1.2"><span class="sec-nr">1.2</span> <span class="sec-title">Installation 
Steps for Other Languages</span></a></h3>

<p><a id="sec:mqi-language-installation"></a>

<p>In general, to use the Machine Query Interface with any programming 
language:

<p>
<ol class="latex">
<li>Install SWI Prolog itself on the machine the application will run 
on.
<li>Check if your SWI Prolog version includes the MQI by launching it 
and typing <code>?- mqi_start([]).</code> If it can't find it, see below 
for how to install it.
<li>Ensure that the system path includes a path to the <code>swipl</code> 
executable from that installation.
<li>Make sure the application (really the user that launches the 
application) has permission to launch the SWI Prolog process. Unless 
your system is unusually locked down, this should be allowed by default. 
If not, you'll need to set the appropriate permissions to allow this.
<li>Install (or write!) the library you'll be using to access the MQI in 
your language of choice.
</ol>

<p>If your SWI Prolog version doesn't yet include the MQI:

<p>
<ol class="latex">
<li>Download the <code>mqi.pl</code> file from the <a class="url" href="https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/packages-mqi/blob/master/mqi.pl">GitHub 
repository</a>.
<li>Open an operating system command prompt and go to the directory 
where you downloaded <code>mqi.pl</code>.
<li>Run the command below. On Windows the command prompt must be <a class="url" href="https://www.wikihow.com/Run-Command-Prompt-As-an-Administrator-on-Windows">run 
as an administrator</a>. On Mac or Linux, start the command with <code>sudo</code> 
as in <code>sudo swipl -s ...</code>.
</ol>

<pre class="code">
swipl -s mqi.pl -g "mqi:install_to_library('mqi.pl')" -t halt
</pre>

<p><h3 id="sec:mqi-toplevel-differences"><a id="sec:1.3"><span class="sec-nr">1.3</span> <span class="sec-title">Prolog 
Language Differences from the Top Level</span></a></h3>

<p><a id="sec:mqi-toplevel-differences"></a>

<p>The Machine Query Interface is designed to act like using the ["top 
level"](quickstart) prompt of SWI Prolog itself (i.e. the "<code>?-</code>" 
prompt). If you've built the Prolog part of your application by loading 
code, running it and debugging it using the normal SWI Prolog top level, 
integrating it with your native language should be straightforward: 
simply run the commands you'd normally run on the top level, but now run 
them using the query APIs provided by the library built for your target 
language. Those APIs will allow you to send the exact same text to 
Prolog and they should execute the same way. Here's an example using the 
Python <code>swiplserver</code> library:

<pre class="code">
% Prolog Top Level
?- member(X, [first, second, third]).
X = first ;
X = second ;
X = third.
</pre>

<pre class="code">
# Python using the swiplserver library
from swiplserver import PrologMQI, PrologThread

with PrologMQI() as mqi:
    with mqi.create_thread() as prolog_thread:
        result = prolog_thread.query("member(X, [first, second, third]).")
        print(result)

first
second
third
</pre>

<p>While the query functionality of the MQI does run on a thread, it 
will always be the <b>same</b> thread, and, if you use a single 
connection, it will only allow queries to be run one at a time, just 
like the top level. Of course, the queries you send can launch threads, 
just like the top level, so you are not limited to a single threaded 
application. There are a few differences from the top level, however:

<p>
<ul class="latex">
<li>Normally, the SWI Prolog top level runs all user code in the context 
of a built-in module called "user", as does the MQI. However, the top 
level allows this to be changed using the <span class="pred-ext">module/1</span> 
predicate. This predicate has no effect when sent to the MQI.
<li>Predefined streams like <code>user_input</code> are initially bound 
to the standard operating system I/O streams (like STDIN) and, since the 
Prolog process is running invisibly, will obviously not work as 
expected. Those streams can be changed, however, by issuing commands 
using system predicates as defined in the SWI Prolog documentation.
<li>Every connection to the MQI runs in its own thread, so opening two 
connections from an application means you are running multithreaded 
code.
</ul>

<p>The basic rule to remember is: any predicates designed to interact 
with or change the default behavior of the top level itself probably 
won't have any effect.

<p><h3 id="sec:mqi-embedded-mode"><a id="sec:1.4"><span class="sec-nr">1.4</span> <span class="sec-title">Embedded 
Mode: Integrating the Machine Query Interface Into a New Programming 
Language</span></a></h3>

<p><a id="sec:mqi-embedded-mode"></a>

<p>The most common way to use the Machine Query Interface is to find a 
library that wraps and exposes it as a native part of another 
programming language such as the Python <code>swiplserver</code> library 
(<a class="sec" href="#sec:1.1">section 1.1</a>). This section describes 
how to build one if there isn't yet a library for your language. To do 
this, you'll need to familiarize yourself with the MQI protocol as 
described in the <a class="pred" href="#mqi_start/1">mqi_start/1</a> 
documentation. However, to give an idea of the scope of work required, 
below is a typical interaction done (invisibly to the user) in the 
implementation of any programming language library:

<p>
<ol class="latex">
<li>Launch the SWI Prolog process using (along with any other options 
the user requests): <code>swipl --quiet -g mqi_start -t halt -- --write_connection_values=true</code>. 
To work, the <code>swipl</code> Prolog executable will need to be on the 
path or the path needs to be specified in the command. This launches SWI 
Prolog, starts the MQI, and writes the chosen port and password to 
STDOUT. This way of launching invokes the <a class="pred" href="#mqi_start/0">mqi_start/0</a> 
predicate that turns off the <code>int</code> (i.e. Interrupt/SIGINT) 
signal to Prolog. This is because some languages (such as Python) use 
that signal during debugging and it would be otherwise passed to the 
client Prolog process and switch it into the debugger. See the <a class="pred" href="#mqi_start/0">mqi_start/0</a> 
predicate for more information on other command line options.
<li>Read the SWI Prolog STDOUT to retrieve the TCP/IP port and password. 
They are sent in that order, delimited by&rsquo;<code>\n</code>&rsquo;.
</ol>

<pre class="code">
$ swipl --quiet -g mqi_start -t halt -- --write_connection_values=true
54501
185786669688147744015809740744888120144
</pre>

<p>Now the server is started. To create a connection:

<p>
<ol class="latex">
<li>Use the language's TCP/IP sockets library to open a socket on the 
specified port of localhost and send the password as a message. Messages 
to and from the MQI are in the form <code>&lt;stringByteLength&gt;.\n&lt;stringBytes&gt;.\n </code> 
where <code>stringByteLength</code> includes the <code>.\n</code> from 
the string. For example: <code>7.\nhello.\n</code> More information on 
the message format (<a class="sec" href="#sec:1.6.1">section 1.6.1</a>) 
is below.
<li>Listen on the socket for a response message of <code>true([[threads(Comm_Thread_ID, Goal_Thread_ID)]])</code> 
(which will be in JSON form) indicating successful creation of the 
connection. <var>Comm_Thread_ID</var> and <var>Goal_Thread_ID</var> are 
the internal Prolog IDs of the two threads that are used for the 
connection. They are sent solely for monitoring and debugging purposes.
</ol>

<p>We can try all of this using the Unix tool <code>nc</code> (netcat) 
(also available for Windows) to interactively connect to the MQI. In <code>nc</code> 
hitting <code>enter</code> sends <code>\n</code> which is what the 
message format requires. The server responses are show indented inline.

<p>We'll use the port and password that were sent to STDOUT above:

<pre class="code">
$ nc 127.0.0.1 54501
41.
185786669688147744015809740744888120144.
    173.
    {
      "args": [
        [
          [
        {
          "args": ["mqi1_conn2_comm", "mqi1_conn2_goal" ],
          "functor":"threads"
        }
          ]
        ]
      ],
      "functor":"true"
    }
</pre>

<p>Now the connection is established. To run queries and shutdown:

<p>
<ol class="latex">
<li>Any of the messages described in the Machine Query Interface 
messages documentation (<a class="sec" href="#sec:1.6">section 1.6</a>) 
can now be sent to run queries and retrieve their answers. For example, 
send the message <code>run(atom(a), -1)</code> to run the synchronous 
query <code>atom(a)</code> with no timeout and wait for the response 
message. It will be <code>true([[]])</code> (in JSON form).
<li>Shutting down the connection is accomplished by sending the message <code>close</code>, 
waiting for the response message of <code>true([[]])</code> (in JSON 
form), and then closing the socket using the socket API of the language. 
If the socket is closed (or fails) before the <code>close</code> message 
is sent, the default behavior of the MQI is to exit the SWI Prolog 
process to avoid leaving the process around. This is to support 
scenarios where the user is running and halting their language debugger 
without cleanly exiting.
<li>Shutting down the launched SWI Prolog process is accomplished by 
sending the <code>quit</code> message and waiting for the response 
message of <code>true([[]])</code> (in JSON form). This will cause an 
orderly shutdown and exit of the process.
</ol>

<p>Continuing with the <code>nc</code> session (the <code>quit</code> 
message isn't shown since the <code>close</code> message closes the 
connection):

<pre class="code">
18.
run(atom(a), -1).
    39.
    {"args": [ [ [] ] ], "functor":"true"}
7.
close.
    39.
    {"args": [ [ [] ] ], "functor":"true"}
</pre>

<p>Note that Unix Domain Sockets can be used instead of a TCP/IP port. 
How to do this is described with <a class="pred" href="#mqi_start/1">mqi_start/1</a>.

<p>Here's the same example running in the R language. Note that this is <b>not</b> 
an example of how to use the MQI from R, it just shows the first code a 
developer would write as they begin to build a nice library to connect R 
to Prolog using the MQI:

<pre class="code">
# Server run with: swipl mqi.pl --port=40001 --password=123
# R Source
print("# Establish connection")

sck = make.socket('localhost', 40001)

print("# Send password")

write.socket(sck, '5.\n') # message length

write.socket(sck, '123.\n') # password

print(read.socket(sck))

print("# Run query")

query = 'run(member(X, [1, 2, 3]), -1).\n'

write.socket(sck, paste(nchar(query), '.\n', sep='')) # message length

write.socket(sck, query) # query

print(read.socket(sck))

print("# Close session")

close.socket(sck)
</pre>

<p>And here's the output:

<pre class="code">
[1] "# Establish connection"

[1] "# Send password"

[1] "172.\n{\n "args": [\n [\n [\n\t{\n\t "args": ["mqi1_conn1_comm", "mqi1_conn1_goal" ],\n\t "functor":"threads"\n\t}\n ]\n ]\n ],\n "functor":"true"\n}"

[1] "# Run query"

[1] "188.\n{\n "args": [\n [\n [ {"args": ["X", 1 ], "functor":"="} ],\n [ {"args": ["X", 2 ], "functor":"="} ],\n [ {"args": ["X", 3 ], "functor":"="} ]\n ]\n ],\n "functor":"true"\n}"

[1] "# Close session"
</pre>

<p>Other notes about creating a new library to communicate with the MQI:

<p>
<ul class="latex">
<li>Where appropriate, use similar names and approaches to the <a class="url" href="https://github.com/EricZinda/swiplserver">Python 
library</a> when designing your language library. This will give 
familiarity and faster learning for users that use more than one 
language.
<li>Use the <span class="pred-ext">debug/1</span> predicate described in 
the <a class="pred" href="#mqi_start/1">mqi_start/1</a> documentation to 
turn on debug tracing. It can really speed up debugging.
<li>Read the STDOUT and STDERR output of the SWI Prolog process and 
output them to the debugging console of the native language to help 
users debug their Prolog application.
</ul>

<p><h3 id="sec:mqi-standalone-mode"><a id="sec:1.5"><span class="sec-nr">1.5</span> <span class="sec-title">Standalone 
Mode: Debugging Prolog Code Used in an Application</span></a></h3>

<p><a id="sec:mqi-standalone-mode"></a>

<p>When using the Machine Query Interface from another language, 
debugging the Prolog code itself can often be done by viewing traces 
from the Prolog native <span class="pred-ext">writeln/1</span> or <span class="pred-ext">debug/3</span> 
predicates. Their output will be shown in the debugger of the native 
language used. Sometimes an issue surfaces deep in an application. When 
this happens, running the application in the native language while 
setting breakpoints and viewing traces in Prolog itself is often the 
best debugging approach. Standalone mode is designed for this scenario.

<p>As the MQI is a multithreaded application, debugging the running code 
requires using the multithreaded debugging features of SWI Prolog as 
described in the section on ["Debugging Threads"](threaddebug) in the 
SWI Prolog documentation. A typical flow for Standalone Mode is:

<p>
<ol class="latex">
<li>Launch SWI Prolog and call the <a class="pred" href="#mqi_start/1">mqi_start/1</a> 
predicate specifying a port and password. Use the <span class="pred-ext">tdebug/0</span> 
predicate to set all threads to debugging mode like this: <code>tdebug, mqi_start([port(4242), password(debugnow)])</code>.
<li>Set the port and password in the initialization API in the native 
language being used.
<li>Launch the application and go through the steps to reproduce the 
issue.
</ol>

<p>In Python this would look like:

<pre class="code">
% From the SWI Prolog top level
?- tdebug, mqi_start([port(4242), password(debugnow)]).
% The graphical front-end will be used for subsequent tracing
true.
</pre>

<pre class="code">
# Python using the swiplserver library {#mqi-library}
from swiplserver import PrologMQI, PrologThread

with PrologMQI(4242, "debugnow") as mqi:
    with mqi.create_thread() as prolog_thread:
        # Your code to be debugged here
</pre>

<p>At this point, all of the multi-threaded debugging tools in SWI 
Prolog are available for debugging the problem. If the issue is an 
unexpected exception, the exception debugging features of SWI Prolog can 
be used to break on the exception and examine the state of the 
application. If it is a logic error, breakpoints can be set to halt at 
the point where the problem appears, etc.

<p>Note that, while using an MQI library to access Prolog will normally 
end and restart the process between runs of the code, running the server 
in standalone mode doesn't clear state between launches of the 
application. You'll either need to relaunch between runs or build your 
application so that it does the initialization at startup.

Query Interface Messages</span></a></h3>

<p><a id="sec:mqi-messages"></a>

<p>The messages the Machine Query Interface responds to are described 
below. A few things are true for all of them:

<p>
<ul class="latex">
<li>Every connection is in its own separate thread. Opening more than 
one connection means the code is running concurrently.
<li>Closing the socket without sending <code>close</code> and waiting 
for a response will halt the process if running in "Embedded Mode" (<a class="sec" href="#sec:1.4">section 
1.4</a>). This is so that stopping a debugger doesn't leave the process 
orphaned.
<li>All messages are request/response messages. After sending, there 
will be exactly one response from the MQI.
<li>Timeout in all of the commands is in seconds. Sending a variable 
(e.g. <var>_</var>) will use the default timeout passed to the initial <a class="pred" href="#mqi_start/1">mqi_start/1</a> 
predicate and <code>-1</code> means no timeout.
<li>All queries are run in the default module context of <code>user</code>. <span class="pred-ext">module/1</span> 
has no effect.
</ul>

<p><h4 id="sec:mqi-message-format"><a id="sec:1.6.1"><span class="sec-nr">1.6.1</span> <span class="sec-title">Machine 
Query Interface Message Format</span></a></h4>

<p><a id="sec:mqi-message-format"></a>

<p>Every Machine Query Interface message is a single valid Prolog term. 
Those that run queries have an argument which represents the query as a 
single term. To run several goals at once use <code>(goal1, goal2, ...)</code> 
as the goal term.

<p>The format of sent and received messages is identical (<code>\n</code> 
stands for the ASCII newline character which is a single byte):

<pre class="code">
&lt;stringByteLength&gt;.\n&lt;stringBytes&gt;.\n.
</pre>

<p>For example, to send <code>hello</code> as a message you would send 
this:

<pre class="code">
7.\nhello.\n
</pre>

<p>
<ul class="latex">
<li><code>&lt;stringByteLength&gt;</code> is the number of bytes of the 
string to follow (including the <code>.\n</code>), in human readable 
numbers, such as <code>15</code> for a 15 byte string. It must be 
followed by <code>.\n</code>.
<li><code>&lt;stringBytes&gt;</code> is the actual message string being 
sent, such as <code>run(atom(a), -1).\n</code>. It must always end with <code>.\n</code>. 
The character encoding used to decode and encode the string is UTF-8.
</ul>

<p>To send a message to the MQI, send a message using the message format 
above to the localhost port or Unix Domain Socket that the MQI is 
listening on. For example, to run the synchronous goal <code>atom(a)</code>, 
send the following message:

<pre class="code">
18.\nrun(atom(a), -1).\n&lt;end of stream&gt;
</pre>

<p>You will receive the response below on the receive stream of the same 
connection you sent on. Note that the answer is in JSON format. If a 
message takes longer than 2 seconds, there will be "heartbeat" 
characters (".") at the beginning of the response message, approximately 
1 every 2 seconds. So, if the query takes 6 seconds for some reason, 
there will be three "." characters first:

<pre class="code">
...12\ntrue([[]]).\n
</pre>

<p><h4 id="sec:mqi-messages"><a id="sec:1.6.2"><span class="sec-nr">1.6.2</span> <span class="sec-title">Machine 
Query Interface Messages Reference</span></a></h4>

<p><a id="sec:mqi-messages"></a>

<p>The full list of Machine Query Interface messages is described below:

<dl class="latex">
<dt><strong>run</strong>(<var>Goal, Timeout</var>)</dt>
<dd class="defbody">
Runs <var>Goal</var> on the connection's designated query thread. Stops 
accepting new commands until the query is finished and it has responded 
with the results. If a previous query is still in progress, waits until 
the previous query finishes (discarding that query's results) before 
beginning the new query.

<p><var>Timeout</var> is in seconds and indicates a timeout for 
generating all results for the query. Sending a variable (e.g. <var>_</var>) 
will use the default timeout passed to the initial <a class="pred" href="#mqi_start/1">mqi_start/1</a> 
predicate and <code>-1</code> means no timeout.

<p>While it is waiting for the query to complete, sends a "." character <b>not</b> 
in message format, just as a single character, once every two seconds to 
proactively ensure that the client is alive. Those should be read and 
discarded by the client.

<p>If a communication failure happens (during a heartbeat or otherwise), 
the connection is terminated, the query is aborted and (if running in 
"Embedded Mode" (<a class="sec" href="#sec:1.4">section 1.4</a>)) the 
SWI Prolog process shuts down.

<p>When completed, sends a response message using the normal message 
format indicating the result.

<p>Response:
<blockquote>
<table class="latex frame-box">

succeeded at least once. The response always includes all answers as if 
run with <code>findall()</code> (see <span class="pred-ext">run_async/3</span> 
below to get individual results back iteratively). Each <var>Answer</var> 
is a list of the assignments of free variables in the answer. If there 
are no free variables, <var>Answer</var> is an empty list. </td></tr>
<tr><td><code>false</code> </td><td>The goal failed. </td></tr>
<tr><td><code>exception(time_limit_exceeded)</code> </td><td>The query 
timed out. </td></tr>
<tr><td><code>exception(Exception)</code> </td><td>An arbitrary 
exception was not caught while running the goal. </td></tr>
<tr><td><code>exception(connection_failed)</code> </td><td>The query 
thread unexpectedly exited. The MQI will no longer be listening after 
this exception. </td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt><strong>run_async</strong>(<var>Goal, Timeout, Find_All</var>)</dt>
<dd class="defbody">
Starts a Prolog query specified by <var>Goal</var> on the connection's 
designated query thread. Answers to the query, including exceptions, are 
retrieved afterwards by sending the <code>async_result</code> message 
(described below). The query can be cancelled by sending the <code>cancel_async</code> 
message. If a previous query is still in progress, waits until that 
query finishes (discarding that query's results) before responding.

<p><var>Timeout</var> is in seconds and indicates a timeout for 
generating all results for the query. Sending a variable (e.g. <var>_</var>) 
will use the default timeout passed to the initial <a class="pred" href="#mqi_start/1">mqi_start/1</a> 
predicate and <code>-1</code> means no timeout.

<p>If the socket closes before a response is sent, the connection is 
terminated, the query is aborted and (if running in "Embedded Mode" (<a class="sec" href="#sec:1.4">section 
1.4</a>)) the SWI Prolog process shuts down.

<p>If it needs to wait for the previous query to complete, it will send 
heartbeat messages (see "Machine Query Interface Message Format" (<a class="sec" href="#sec:1.6.1">section 
1.6.1</a>)) while it waits. After it responds, however, it does not send 
more heartbeats. This is so that it can begin accepting new commands 
immediately after responding so the client.

<p><code>Find_All == true</code> means generate one response to an <code>async_result</code> 
message with all of the answers to the query (as in the <code>run</code> 
message above). <code>Find_All == false</code> generates a single 
response to an <code>async_result</code> message per answer.

<p>Response:
<blockquote>
<table class="latex frame-box">
<tr><td><code>true([[]])</code> </td><td>The goal was successfully 
parsed. </td></tr>
<tr><td><code>exception(Exception)</code> </td><td>An error occurred 
parsing the goal. </td></tr>

thread unexpectedly shut down. The MQI will no longer be listening after 
this exception. </td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt><strong>cancel_async</strong></dt>
<dd class="defbody">
Attempt to cancel a query started by the <code>run_async</code> message 
in a way that allows further queries to be run on this Prolog thread 
afterwards.

<p>If there is a goal running, injects a <code>throw(cancel_goal)</code> 
into the executing goal to attempt to stop the goal's execution. Begins 
accepting new commands immediately after responding. Does not inject <span class="pred-ext">abort/0</span> 
because this would kill the connection's designated thread and the 
system is designed to maintain thread local data for the client. This 
does mean it is a "best effort" cancel since the exception can be 
caught.

<p><code>cancel_async</code> is guaranteed to either respond with an 
exception (if there is no query or pending results from the last query), 
or safely attempt to stop the last executed query even if it has already 
finished.

<p>To guarantee that a query is cancelled, send <code>close</code> and 
close the socket.

<p>It is not necessary to determine the outcome of <code>cancel_async</code> 
after sending it and receiving a response. Further queries can be 
immediately run. They will start after the current query stops.

<p>However, if you do need to determine the outcome or determine when 
the query stops, send <code>async_result</code>. Using <code>Timeout = 0</code> 
is recommended since the query might have caught the exception or still 
be running. Sending <code>async_result</code> will find out the 
"natural" result of the goal's execution. The "natural" result depends 
on the particulars of what the code actually did. The response could be:
<blockquote>
<table class="latex frame-box">
<tr><td><code>exception(cancel_goal)</code> </td><td>The query was 
running and did not catch the exception. I.e. the goal was successfully 
cancelled. </td></tr>
<tr><td><code>exception(time_limit_exceeded)</code> </td><td>The query 
timed out before getting cancelled. </td></tr>
<tr><td><code>exception(Exception)</code> </td><td>They query hits 
another exception before it has a chance to be cancelled. </td></tr>
<tr><td>A valid answer</td><td>The query finished before being 
cancelled. </td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that you will need to continue sending <code>async_result</code> 
until you receive an <code>exception(Exception)</code> message if you 
want to be sure the query is finished (see documentation for <code>async_result</code>).

<p>Response:
<blockquote>
<table class="latex frame-box">
<tr><td><code>true([[]])</code> </td><td>There is a query running or 
there are pending results for the last query. </td></tr>
<tr><td><code>exception(no_query)</code> </td><td>There is no query or 
pending results from a query to cancel. </td></tr>
<tr><td><code>exception(connection_failed)</code> </td><td>The 
connection has been unexpectedly shut down. The MQI will no longer be 
listening after this exception. </td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dt><strong>async_result</strong>(<var>Timeout</var>)</dt>
<dd class="defbody">
Get results from a query that was started via a <code>run_async</code> 
message. Used to get results for all cases: if the query terminates 
normally, is cancelled by sending a <code>cancel_async</code> message, 
or times out.

<p>Each response to an <code>async_result</code> message responds with 
one result and, when there are no more results, responds with <code>exception(no_more_results)</code> 
or whatever exception stopped the query. Receiving any <code>exception</code> 
response except <code>exception(result_not_available)</code> means there 
are no more results. If <code>run_async</code> was run with <code>Find_All == false</code>, 
multiple <code>async_result</code> messages may be required before 
receiving the final exception.

<p>Waits <var>Timeout</var> seconds for a result. <code>Timeout == -1</code> 
or sending a variable for <var>Timeout</var> indicates no timeout. If 
the timeout is exceeded and no results are ready, sends <code>exception(result_not_available)</code>.

<p>Some examples:
<blockquote>
<table class="latex frame-box">
<tr><td>If the query succeeds with N answers...</td><td><code>async_result</code> 
messages 1 to N will receive each answer, in order, and <code>async_result</code> 
message N+1 will receive <code>exception(no_more_results)</code> </td></tr>
<tr><td>If the query fails (i.e. has no answers)...</td><td><code>async_result</code> 
message 1 will receive <code>false</code> and <code>async_result</code> 
message 2 will receive <code>exception(no_more_results)</code> </td></tr>
<tr><td>If the query times out after one answer...</td><td><code>async_result</code> 
message 1 will receive the first answer and <code>async_result</code> 
message 2 will receive <code>exception(time_limit_exceeded)</code> </td></tr>
<tr><td>If the query is cancelled after it had a chance to get 3 
answers...</td><td><code>async_result</code> messages 1 to 3 will 
receive each answer, in order, and <code>async_result</code> message 4 
will receive <code>exception(cancel_goal)</code> </td></tr>
<tr><td>If the query throws an exception before returning any results...</td><td><code>async_result</code> 
message 1 will receive <code>exception(Exception)</code> </td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that, after sending <code>cancel_async</code>, calling <code>async_result</code> 
will return the "natural" result of the goal's execution. The "natural" 
result depends on the particulars of what the code actually did since 
this is multi-threaded and there are race conditions. This is described 
more below in the response section and above in <code>cancel_async</code>.

<p>Response:
<blockquote>
<table class="latex frame-box">
<tr><td><code>true([Answer1, Answer2, ... ])</code> </td><td>The next 
answer from the query is a successful answer. Whether there are more 
than one <var>Answer</var> in the response depends on the <code>findall</code> 
setting. Each <var>Answer</var> is a list of the assignments of free 
variables in the answer. If there are no free variables, <var>Answer</var> 
is an empty list. </td></tr>
<tr><td><code>false</code> </td><td>The query failed with no answers. </td></tr>
<tr><td><code>exception(no_query)</code> </td><td>There is no query in 
progress. </td></tr>

running query and no results were available in <var>Timeout</var> 
seconds. </td></tr>
<tr><td><code>exception(no_more_results)</code> </td><td>There are no 
more answers and no other exception occurred. </td></tr>
<tr><td><code>exception(cancel_goal)</code> </td><td>The next answer is 
an exception caused by <code>cancel_async</code>. Indicates no more 
answers. </td></tr>
<tr><td><code>exception(time_limit_exceeded)</code> </td><td>The query 
timed out generating the next answer (possibly in a race condition 
before getting cancelled). Indicates no more answers. </td></tr>
<tr><td><code>exception(Exception)</code> </td><td>The next answer is an 
arbitrary exception. This can happen after <code>cancel_async</code> if 
the <code>cancel_async</code> exception is caught or the code hits 
another exception first. Indicates no more answers. </td></tr>

<dd class="defbody">
Starts a Prolog Machine Query Interface ('MQI') using <var>Options</var>. 
The MQI is normally started automatically by a library built for a 
particular programming language such as the <code>swiplserver</code> 
Python library (<a class="sec" href="#sec:1.1">section 1.1</a>), but 
starting manually can be useful when debugging Prolog code in some 
scenarios. See the documentation on "Standalone Mode" (<a class="sec" href="#sec:1.5">section 
1.5</a>) for more information.

<p>Once started, the MQI listens for TCP/IP or Unix Domain Socket 
connections and authenticates them using the password provided (or 
created depending on options) before processing any messages. The 
messages processed by the MQI are described below (<a class="sec" href="#sec:1.6">section 
1.6</a>).

<p>For debugging, the server outputs traces using the <span class="pred-ext">debug/3</span> 
predicate so that the server operation can be observed by using the <span class="pred-ext">debug/1</span> 
predicate. Run the following commands to see them:

<p>
<ul class="latex">
<li><code>debug(mqi(protocol))</code>: Traces protocol messages to show 
the flow of commands and connections. It is designed to avoid filling 
the screen with large queries and results to make it easier to read.
<li><code>debug(mqi(query))</code>: Traces messages that involve each 
query and its results. Therefore it can be quite verbose depending on 
the query. __<var>Options</var>__

<p><var>Options</var> is a list containing any combination of the 
following options. When used in the Prolog top level (i.e. in Standalone 
Mode (<a class="sec" href="#sec:1.5">section 1.5</a>)), these are 
specified as normal Prolog options like this:

<pre class="code">
mqi_start([unix_domain_socket(Socket), password('a password')])
</pre>

<p>When using "Embedded Mode" (<a class="sec" href="#sec:1.4">section 
1.4</a>) they are passed using the same name but as normal command line 
arguments like this:

<pre class="code">
swipl --quiet -g mqi_start -t halt -- --write_connection_values=true
--password="a password" --create_unix_domain_socket=true
</pre>

<p>Note the use of quotes around values that could confuse command line 
processing like spaces (e.g. "a password") and that
<code>unix_domain_socket(Variable)</code> is written as
<code>--create_unix_domain_socket=true</code> on the command line. See 
below for more information.
<li>port(?Port) The TCP/IP port to bind to on localhost. This option is 
ignored if the <span class="pred-ext">unix_domain_socket/1</span> option 
is set. Port is either a legal TCP/IP port number (integer) or a 
variable term like <var>Port</var>. If it is a variable, it causes the 
system to select a free port and unify the variable with the selected 
port as in <span class="pred-ext">tcp_bind/2</span>. If the option <code>write_connection_values(true)</code> 
is set, the selected port is output to STDOUT followed by <code>\n</code> 
on startup to allow the client language library to retrieve it in 
"Embedded Mode" (<a class="sec" href="#sec:1.4">section 1.4</a>).
<li>unix_domain_socket(?Unix_Domain_Socket_Path_And_File) If set, Unix 
Domain Sockets will be used as the way to communicate with the server. <var>Unix_Domain_Socket_Path_And_File</var> 
specifies the fully qualified path and filename to use for the socket.

<p>To have one generated instead (recommended), pass <var>Unix_Domain_Socket_Path_And_File</var> 
as a variable when calling from the Prolog top level and the variable 
will be unified with a created filename. If launching in "Embedded Mode" 
(<a class="sec" href="#sec:1.4">section 1.4</a>), instead pass <code>--create_unix_domain_socket=true</code> 
since there isn't a way to specify variables from the command line. When 
generating the file, a temporary directory will be created using <span class="pred-ext">tmp_file/2</span> 
and a socket file will be created within that directory following the 
below requirements. If the directory and file are unable to be created 
for some reason, <a class="pred" href="#mqi_start/1">mqi_start/1</a> 
fails.

<p>Regardless of whether the file is specified or generated, if the 
option <code>write_connection_values(true)</code> is set, the fully 
qualified path to the generated file is output to STDOUT followed by <code>\n</code> 
on startup to allow the client language library to retrieve it.

<p>Specifying a file to use should follow the same guidelines as the 
generated file:

<p>
<ul class="latex">
<li>If the file exists when the MQI is launched, it will be deleted.
<li>The Prolog process will attempt to create and, if Prolog exits 
cleanly, delete this file (and directory if it was created) when the MQI 
closes. This means the directory from a specified file must have the 
appropriate permissions to allow the Prolog process to do so.
<li>For security reasons, the filename should not be predictable and the 
directory it is contained in should have permissions set so that files 
created are only accessible to the current user.
<li>The path must be below 92 <b>bytes</b> long (including null 
terminator) to be portable according to the Linux documentation.
</ul>

<p>
<li>password(?Password) The password required for a connection. If not 
specified (recommended), the MQI will generate one as a Prolog string 
type since Prolog atoms are globally visible (be sure not to convert to 
an atom for this reason). If <var>Password</var> is a variable it will 
be unified with the created password. Regardless of whether the password 
is specified or generated, if the option <code>write_connection_values(true)</code> 
is set, the password is output to STDOUT followed by <code>\n</code> on 
startup to allow the client language library to retrieve it. This is the 
recommended way to integrate the MQI with a language as it avoids 
including the password as source code. This option is only included so 
that a known password can be supplied for when the MQI is running in 
Standalone Mode.
<li><code>query_timeout(+Seconds)</code> Sets the default time in 
seconds that a query is allowed to run before it is cancelled. This can 
be overridden on a query by query basis. If not set, the default is no 
timeout (<code>-1</code>).
<li><code>pending_connections(+Count)</code> Sets the number of pending 
connections allowed for the MQI as in <span class="pred-ext">tcp_listen/2</span>. 
If not provided, the default is <code>5</code>.
<li><code>run_server_on_thread(+Run_Server_On_Thread)</code> Determines 
whether <a class="pred" href="#mqi_start/1">mqi_start/1</a> runs in the 
background on its own thread or blocks until the MQI shuts down. Must be 
missing or set to <code>true</code> when running in "Embedded Mode" (<a class="sec" href="#sec:1.4">section 
1.4</a>) so that the SWI Prolog process can exit properly. If not set, 
the default is <code>true</code>.
<li>server_thread(?Server_Thread) Specifies or retrieves the name of the 
thread the MQI will run on if <code>run_server_on_thread(true)</code>. 
Passing in an atom for Server_Thread will only set the server thread 
name if <code>run_server_on_thread(true)</code>. If <var>Server_Thread</var> 
is a variable, it is unified with a generated name.
<li><code>write_connection_values(+Write_Connection_Values)</code> 
Determines whether the server writes the port (or generated Unix Domain 
Socket) and password to STDOUT as it initializes. Used by language 
libraries to retrieve this information for connecting. If not set, the 
default is <code>false</code>.
<li><code>write_output_to_file(+File)</code> Redirects STDOUT and STDERR 
to the file path specified. Useful for debugging the MQI when it is 
being used in "Embedded Mode" (<a class="sec" href="#sec:1.4">section 
1.4</a>). If using multiple MQI instances in one SWI Prolog instance, 
only set this on the first one. Each time it is set the output will be 
redirected.

Main entry point for running the Machine Query Interface in "Embedded 
Mode" (<a class="sec" href="#sec:1.4">section 1.4</a>) and designed to 
be called from the command line. Embedded Mode is used when launching 
the Machine Query Interface as an embedded part of another language 
(e.g. Python). Calling <a class="pred" href="#mqi_start/0">mqi_start/0</a> 
from Prolog interactively is not recommended as it depends on Prolog 
exiting to stop the MQI, instead use <a class="pred" href="#mqi_start/1">mqi_start/1</a> 
for interactive use.

<p>To launch embedded mode:

<pre class="code">
swipl --quiet -g mqi_start -t halt -- --write_connection_values=true
</pre>

<p>This will start SWI Prolog and invoke the <a class="pred" href="#mqi_start/0">mqi_start/0</a> 
predicate and exit the process when that predicate stops. Any command 
line arguments after the standalone <code>--</code> will be passed as 
Options. These are the same Options that <a class="pred" href="#mqi_start/1">mqi_start/1</a> 
accepts and are passed to it directly. Some options are expressed 
differently due to command line limitations, see <a class="pred" href="#mqi_start/1">mqi_start/1</a> 
Options for more information.

<p>Any Option values that cause issues during command line parsing (such 
as spaces) should be passed with <code>""</code> like this:
