1 Introduction
**************

Org-roam is a tool for networked thought.  It reproduces some of Roam
Research’s (https://roamresearch.com/) (1) key features within Org-mode
(https://orgmode.org/).

   Org-roam allows for effortless non-hierarchical note-taking: with
Org-roam, notes flow naturally, making note-taking fun and easy.
Org-roam augments the Org-mode syntax, and will work for anyone already
using Org-mode for their personal wiki.

   Org-roam leverages the mature ecosystem around Org-mode.  For
example, it has first-class support for org-ref
(https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref) for citation management, and is
able to piggyback off Org’s excellent LaTeX and source-block evaluation
capabilities.

   Org-roam provides these benefits over other tooling:

   • *Privacy and Security:* Your personal wiki belongs only to you,
     entirely offline and in your control.  Encrypt your notes with GPG.

   • *Longevity of Plain Text:* Unlike web solutions like Roam Research,
     the notes are first and foremost plain Org-mode files – Org-roam
     simply builds an auxiliary database to give the personal wiki
     superpowers.  Having your notes in plain-text is crucial for the
     longevity of your wiki.  Never have to worry about proprietary web
     solutions being taken down.  The notes are still functional even if
     Org-roam ceases to exist.

   • *Free and Open Source:* Org-roam is free and open-source, which
     means that if you feel unhappy with any part of Org-roam, you may
     choose to extend Org-roam, or open a pull request.

   • *Leverage the Org-mode ecosystem:* Over the decades, Emacs and
     Org-mode has developed into a mature system for plain-text
     organization.  Building upon Org-mode already puts Org-roam
     light-years ahead of many other solutions.

   • *Built on Emacs:* Emacs is also a fantastic interface for editing
     text, and Org-roam inherits many of the powerful text-navigation
     and editing packages available to Emacs.

2 Target Audience
*****************

Org-roam is a tool that will appear unfriendly to anyone unfamiliar with
Emacs and Org-mode, but it is also extremely powerful to those willing
to put effort inn mastering the intricacies.  Org-roam stands on the
shoulders of giants.  Emacs was first created in 1976, and remains the
tool of choice for many for editing text and designing textual
interfaces.  The malleability of Emacs allowed the creation of Org-mode,
an all-purpose plain-text system for maintaining TODO lists, planning
projects, and authoring documents.  Both of these tools are incredibly
vast and require significant time investment to master.

   Org-roam assumes only basic familiarity with these tools.  It is not
difficult to get up and running with basic text-editing functionality,
but one will only fully appreciate the power of building Roam
functionality into Emacs and Org-mode when the usage of these tools
become more advanced.

   One key advantage to Org-roam is that building on top of Emacs gives
it malleability.  This is especially important for note-taking
workflows.  It is our belief that note-taking workflows are extremely
personal, and there is no one tool that’s perfect for you.  Org-mode and
Org-roam allows you to discover what works for you, and build that
perfect tool for yourself.

   If you are new to the software, and choose to take this leap of
faith, I hope you find yourself equally entranced as Neal Stephenson
was.

     Emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the
     same way that the noonday sun does the stars.  It is not just
     bigger and brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish.  –
     Neal Stephenson, In the Beginning was the Command Line (1998)

3 A Brief Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method
*************************************************

Org-roam provides utilities for maintaining a digital slip-box.  This
section aims to provide a brief introduction to the “slip-box”, or
“Zettelkasten” method.  By providing some background on the method, we
hope that the design decisions of Org-roam will become clear, and that
will aid in using Org-roam appropriately.  In this section we will
introduce terms commonly used within the Zettelkasten community and the
Org-roam forums.

   The Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing.  It
places heavy emphasis on connecting ideas, building up a web of thought.
Hence, it is well suited for knowledge workers and intellectual tasks,
such as conducting research.  The Zettelkasten can act as a research
partner, where conversations with it may produce new and surprising
lines of thought.

   This method is attributed to German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, who
using the method had produced volumes of written works.  Luhmann’s
slip-box was simply a box of cards.  These cards are small – often only
large enough to fit a single concept.  The size limitation encourages
ideas to be broken down into individual concepts.  These ideas are
explicitly linked together.  The breakdown of ideas encourages
tangential exploration of ideas, increasing the surface for thought.
Making linking explicit between notes also encourages one to think about
the connections between concepts.

   At the corner of each note, Luhmann ascribed each note with an
ordered ID, allowing him to link and jump between notes.  In Org-roam,
we simply use hyperlinks.

   Org-roam is the slip-box, digitalized in Org-mode.  Every zettel
(card) is a plain-text, Org-mode file.  In the same way one would
maintain a paper slip-box, Org-roam makes it easy to create new zettels,
pre-filling boilerplate content using a powerful templating system.

   *Fleeting notes*

   A slip-box requires a method for quickly capturing ideas.  These are
called *fleeting notes*: they are simple reminders of information or
ideas that will need to be processed later on, or trashed.  This is
typically accomplished using ‘org-capture’ (see *note (org)Capture::),
or using Org-roam’s daily notes functionality (see *note Daily-notes::).
This provides a central inbox for collecting thoughts, to be processed
later into permanent notes.

   *Permanent notes*

   Permanent notes are further split into two categories: *literature
notes* and *concept notes*.  Literature notes can be brief annotations
on a particular source (e.g.  book, website or paper), that you’d like
to access later on.  Concept notes require much more care in authoring:
they need to be self-explanatory and detailed.  Org-roam’s templating
system supports the addition of different templates to facilitate the
creation of these notes.

   For further reading on the Zettelkasten method, “How to Take Smart
Notes” by Sonke Ahrens is a decent guide.

4 Installation
**************

Org-roam can be installed using Emacs’ package manager or manually from
its development repository.

* Menu:

* Installing from MELPA::
* Installing from Apt::
* Installing from Source::
* Post-Installation Tasks::


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Installing from MELPA,  Next: Installing from Apt,  Up: Installation

4.1 Installing from MELPA
=========================

Org-roam is available from Melpa and Melpa-Stable.  If you haven’t used
Emacs’ package manager before, you may familiarize yourself with it by
reading the documentation in the Emacs manual, see *note
(emacs)Packages::.  Then, add one of the archives to ‘package-archives’:

   • To use Melpa:

     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)

   • To use Melpa-Stable:

     (require 'package)
     (add-to-list 'package-archives
                  '("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)

   Org-roam also depends on a recent version of Org, which can be
obtained in Org’s package repository (see *note (org)Installation::).
To use Org’s ELPA archive:

     (add-to-list 'package-archives '("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/") t)

   Once you have added your preferred archive, you need to update the
local package list using:

     M-x package-refresh-contents RET

   Once you have done that, you can install Org-roam and its
dependencies using:

     M-x package-install RET org-roam RET

   Now see *note Post-Installation Tasks::.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Installing from Apt,  Next: Installing from Source,  Prev: Installing from MELPA,  Up: Installation

4.2 Installing from Apt
=======================

Users of Debian 11 or later or Ubuntu 20.10 or later can simply install
Org-roam using Apt:

     apt-get install elpa-org-roam

   Org-roam will then be autoloaded into Emacs.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Installing from Source,  Next: Post-Installation Tasks,  Prev: Installing from Apt,  Up: Installation

4.3 Installing from Source
==========================

You may install Org-roam directly from the repository on GitHub
(https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam) if you like.  This will give you
access to the latest version hours or days before it appears on MELPA,
and months (or more) before it is added to the Debian or Ubuntu
repositories.  This will also give you access to various developmental
branches that may be available.

   Note, however, that development version, and especially any feature
branches, may not always be in working order.  You’ll need to be
prepared to do some debugging, or to manually roll-back to working
versions, if you install from GitHub.

   Installing from GitHub requires that you clone the repository:

     git clone https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam.git /path/to/org/roam

   where ‘./path/to/org/roam’ is the location you will store your copy
of the code.

   Next, you need to add this location to your load path, and ‘require’
the Org-roam library.  Add the following code to your ‘.emacs’:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org/roam")
     (require 'org-roam)

   You now have Org-roam installed.  However, you don’t necessarily have
the dependencies that it requires.  These include:

   • dash

   • f

   • s

   • org

   • emacsql

   • emacsql-sqlite3

   You can install this manually as well, or get the latest version from
MELPA.  You may wish to use use-package
(https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package), straight.el
(https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el) to help manage this.

   If you would like to install the manual for access from Emacs’
built-in Info system, you’ll need to compile the .texi source file, and
install it in an appropriate location.

   To compile the .texi source file, from a terminal navigate to the
‘/doc’ subdirectory of the Org-roam repository, and run the following:

     make infodir=/path/to/my/info/files install-info

   Where ‘/path/to/my/info/files’ is the location where you keep info
files.  This target directory needs to be stored in the variable
‘Info-default-directory-list‘.  If you aren’t using one of the default
info locations, you can configure this with the following in your
‘.emacs’ file:

     (require 'info)
     (add-to-list 'Info-default-directory-list
                  "/path/to/my/info/files")

   You can also use one of the default locations, such as:

   • _usr/local/share/info_

   • _usr/share/info_

   • _usr/local/share/info_

   If you do this, you’ll need to make sure you have write-access to
that location, or run the above ‘make’ command as root.

   Now that the info file is ready, you need to add it to the
corresponding ‘dir’ file:

     install-info /path/to/my/info/files/org-roam.info /path/to/my/info/files/dir


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Post-Installation Tasks,  Prev: Installing from Source,  Up: Installation

4.4 Post-Installation Tasks
===========================

Org-roam requires ‘sqlite3’ to be locatable by Emacs (i.e.  on
‘exec-path’).  Please ensure that ‘sqlite3’ is installed appropriately
on your operating system.  You can verify that this is the case by
executing (1):

     (executable-find "sqlite3")

   If you have ‘sqlite3’ installed, and ‘executable-find’ still reports
‘nil’, then the path to the executable is not a member of the Emacs
variable ‘exec-path’.  Rectify this by manually adding the path within
your Emacs configuration:

     (add-to-list 'exec-path "path/to/sqlite3")

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Two easy ways to evaluate elisp: 1) Place the cursor after the
closing paren and run ‘M-x eval-last-sexp RET’ or 2) Press ‘C-c C-c’
with your cursor in an Org file code block (like ‘#+BEGIN_SRC
emacs-lisp’).

File: org-roam.info,  Node: The Org-roam Node,  Next: Links between Nodes,  Up: Getting Started

5.1 The Org-roam Node
=====================

We first begin with some terminology we’ll use throughout the manual.
We term the basic denomination in Org-roam a node.  We define a node as
follows:

     A node is any headline or top level file with an ID.

   For example, with this example file content:

     :PROPERTIES:
     :ID:       foo
     :END:
     #+title: Foo

     * Bar
     :PROPERTIES:
     :ID:       bar
     :END:

   We create two nodes:

   • A file node “Foo” with id ‘foo’.

   • A headline node “Bar” with id ‘bar’.

   Headlines without IDs will not be considered Org-roam nodes.  Org IDs
can be added to files or headlines via the interactive command ‘M-x
org-id-get-create’.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Links between Nodes,  Next: Setting up Org-roam,  Prev: The Org-roam Node,  Up: Getting Started

5.2 Links between Nodes
=======================

We link between nodes using Org’s standard ID link (e.g.  ‘id:foo’).
While only ID links will be considered during the computation of links
between nodes, Org-roam caches all other links in the documents for
external use.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Setting up Org-roam,  Next: Creating and Linking Nodes,  Prev: Links between Nodes,  Up: Getting Started

5.3 Setting up Org-roam
=======================

Org-roam’s capabilities stem from its aggressive caching: it crawls all
files within ‘org-roam-directory’, keeping a cache of all its links and
nodes, while making sure that the cache is consistent.

   To first start using Org-roam, one needs to pick a location to store
the Org-roam files.  The directory that will contain your notes is
specified by the variable ‘org-roam-directory’.  Org-roam searches
recursively within ‘org-roam-directory’ for notes.  This variable needs
to be set before any calls to Org-roam functions.  For this tutorial,
create an empty directory, and set ‘org-roam-directory’:

     (make-directory "~/org-roam")
     (setq org-roam-directory "~/org-roam")

   Next, we need to setup Org-roam to maintain cache consistency.  This
is achieved by running ‘M-x org-roam-setup’.  To ensure that Org-roam is
available on startup, one can place this in their Emacs configuration:

     (require 'org-roam)
     (org-roam-setup)

   To build the cache manually, one can run ‘M-x
org-roam-db-build-cache’.  Cache builds may take a while the first time,
but is often instantaneous in subsequent runs because it only
reprocesses modified files.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Creating and Linking Nodes,  Prev: Setting up Org-roam,  Up: Getting Started

5.4 *TODO* Creating and Linking Nodes
=====================================

Org-roam makes it easy to create notes and link them together.  There
are 2 main functions for creating nodes:

   • ‘org-roam-node-insert’: creates a node if it does not exist, and
     inserts a link to the node at point.

   • ‘org-roam-node-find’: creates a node if it does not exist, and
     visits the node.

   Let’s first try ‘org-roam-node-find’.  Calling ‘M-x
org-roam-node-find’ will show a list of titles for nodes that reside in
‘org-roam-directory’.  It should show nothing right now, since there are
no notes in the directory.  Enter the title of the note you wish to
create, and press ‘RET’.  This begins the note creation process.  This
process uses ‘org-capture’’s templating system, and can be customized
(see *note The Templating System::).  Using the default template,
pressing ‘C-c C-c’ finishes the note capture.

   Now that we have a node, we can try inserting a link to the node
using ‘M-x org-roam-node-insert’.  This brings up the list of nodes,
which should contain the node you just created.  Selecting the node will
insert an ‘id:’ link to the node.  If you instead entered a title that
does not exist, you will once again be brought through the node creation
process.  To enable link auto-completion, see *note Completion::.

6 *TODO* Viewing the links
**************************

Org-roam provides an interface to view relationships with other notes
(backlinks, reference links, unlinked references etc.).  To pop up this
info buffer, call ‘M-x org-roam-buffer’.

==================


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Refs,  Prev: Aliases,  Up: Node Properties

7.3 *TODO* Refs
===============

Refs are unique identifiers for files.  For example, a note for a
website may contain a ref:

     #+title: Google
     #+roam_key: https://www.google.com/

   These keys allow references to the key to show up in the backlinks
buffer.  For instance, with the example above, if another file then
links to <https://www.google.com>, that will show up as a “Ref
Backlink”.

   These keys also come in useful for when taking website notes, using
the ‘roam-ref’ protocol (see *note Roam Protocol::).

   org-ref (https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref) citation keys can also
be used as refs:

     #+title: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
     #+roam_key: cite:chen18_neural_ordin_differ_equat

 [image src="images/org-ref-citelink.png" ]

Figure: org-ref-citelink

   You may assign multiple refs to a single file, for example when you
want multiple papers in a series to share the same note, or an article
has a citation key and a URL at the same time.

17.1 Org-roam’s Design Principles
=================================

Org-roam is primarily motivated by the need for a dual representation.
We (humans) love operating in a plain-text environment.  The syntax
rules of Org-mode are simple and fit snugly within our brain.  This also
allows us to use the tools and packages we love to explore and edit our
notes.  Org-mode is simply the most powerful plain-text format
available, with support for images, LaTeX, TODO planning and much more.

   But this plain-text format is simply ill-suited for exploration of
these notes: plain-text is simply not amenable for answering
large-scale, complex queries (e.g.  how many tasks do I have that are
due by next week?).  Interfaces such as Org-agenda slow to a crawl when
the number of files becomes unwieldy, which can quickly become the case.

   At its core, Org-roam provides a database abstraction layer,
providing a dual representation of what’s already available in
plain-text.  This allows us (humans) to continue working with
plain-text, while programs can utilize the database layer to perform
complex queries.  These capabilities include, but are not limited to:

   • link graph traversal and visualization

   • Instantaneous SQL-like queries on headlines
        • What are my TODOs, scheduled for X, or due by Y?

   All of these functionality is powered by this database abstraction
layer.  Hence, at its core Org-roam’s primary goal is to provide a
resilient dual representation that is cheap to maintain, easy to
understand, and is as up-to-date as it possibly can.  Org-roam also then
exposes an API to this database abstraction layer for users who would
like to perform programmatic queries on their Org files.

18 The Templating System
************************

Rather than creating blank files on ‘org-roam-insert’ and
‘org-roam-find-file’, it may be desirable to prefill the file with
templated content.  This may include:

   • Time of creation

   • File it was created from

   • Clipboard content

   • Any other data you may want to input manually

   This requires a complex template insertion system.  Fortunately, Org
ships with a powerful one: ‘org-capture’ (see *note (org)capture::).
However, org-capture was not designed for such use.  Org-roam abuses
‘org-capture’, extending its syntax and capabilities.  To first
understand how org-roam’s templating system works, it may be useful to
look into basic usage of ‘org-capture’.

   For these reasons, Org-roam capture templates are not compatible with
regular ‘org-capture’.  Hence, Org-roam’s templates can be customized by
instead modifying the variable ‘org-roam-capture-templates’.  Just like
‘org-capture-templates’, ‘org-roam-capture-templates’ can contain
multiple templates.  If ‘org-roam-capture-templates’ only contains one
template, there will be no prompt for template selection.

File: org-roam.info,  Node: Template Walkthrough,  Next: Org-roam Template Expansion,  Up: The Templating System

18.1 Template Walkthrough
=========================

To demonstrate the additions made to org-capture templates.  Here, we
walkthrough the default template, reproduced below.

     ("d" "default" plain (function org-roam--capture-get-point)
          "%?"
          :file-name "%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-${slug}"
          :head "#+title: ${title}\n"
          :unnarrowed t)

   • The template has short key ‘"d"’.  If you have only one template,
     org-roam automatically chooses this template for you.

   • The template is given a description of ‘"default"’.

   • ‘plain’ text is inserted.  Other options include Org headings via
     ‘entry’.

   • ‘(function org-roam--capture-get-point)’ should not be changed.

   • ‘"%?"’ is the template inserted on each call to
     ‘org-roam-capture-’.  This template means don’t insert any content,
     but place the cursor here.

   • ‘:file-name’ is the file-name template for a new note, if it
     doesn’t yet exist.  This creates a file at path that looks like
     ‘/path/to/org-roam-directory/20200213032037-foo.org’.  This
     template also allows you to specify if you want the note to go into
     a subdirectory.  For example, the template ‘private/${slug}’ will
     create notes in ‘/path/to/org-roam-directory/private’.

   • ‘:head’ contains the initial template to be inserted (once only),
     at the beginning of the file.  Here, the title global attribute is
     inserted.

   • ‘:unnarrowed t’ tells org-capture to show the contents for the
     whole file, rather than narrowing to just the entry.

   Other options you may want to learn about include
‘:immediate-finish’.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Org-roam Template Expansion,  Prev: Template Walkthrough,  Up: The Templating System

18.2 Org-roam Template Expansion
================================

Org-roam’s template definitions also extend org-capture’s template
syntax, to allow prefilling of strings.  We have seen a glimpse of this
in *note Template Walkthrough: Template Walkthrough.

   In org-roam templates, the ‘${var}’ syntax allows for the expansion
of variables, stored in ‘org-roam-capture--info’.  For example, during
‘org-roam-insert’, the user is prompted for a title.  Upon entering a
non-existent title, the ‘title’ key in ‘org-roam-capture--info’ is set
to the provided title.  ‘${title}’ is then expanded into the provided
title during the org-capture process.  Any variables that do not contain
strings, are prompted for values using ‘completing-read’.

   After doing this expansion, the org-capture’s template expansion
system is used to fill up the rest of the template.  You may read up
more on this on org-capture’s documentation page
(https://orgmode.org/manual/Template-expansion.html#Template-expansion).

   To illustrate this dual expansion process, take for example the
template string: ‘"%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-${title}"’, with the title ‘"Foo"’.
The template is first expanded into ‘%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>-Foo’.  Then
org-capture expands ‘%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>’ with timestamp: e.g.
‘20200213032037-Foo’.

   All of the flexibility afforded by Emacs and Org-mode are available.
For example, if you want to encode a UTC timestamp in the filename, you
can take advantage of org-mode’s ‘%(EXP)’ template expansion to call
‘format-time-string’ directly to provide its third argument to specify
UTC.

     ("d" "default" plain (function org-roam--capture-get-point)
          "%?"
          :file-name "%(format-time-string \"%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M-%SZ--${slug}\" (current-time) t)"
          :head "#+title: ${title}\n"
          :unnarrowed t)

19.1 Directories and Files
==========================

This section concerns the placement and creation of files.

 -- Variable: org-roam-directory

     This is the default path to Org-roam files.  All Org files, at any
     level of nesting, are considered part of the Org-roam.

 -- Variable: org-roam-db-location

     Location of the Org-roam database.  If this is non-nil, the
     Org-roam sqlite database is saved here.

     It is the user’s responsibility to set this correctly, especially
     when used with multiple Org-roam instances.

 -- Variable: org-roam-file-exclude-regexp

     Files matching this regular expression are excluded from the
     Org-roam.

19.2 The Org-roam Buffer
========================

The Org-roam buffer displays backlinks for the currently active Org-roam
note.

 -- User Option: org-roam-buffer

     The name of the org-roam buffer.  Defaults to ‘*org-roam*’.

 -- User Option: org-roam-buffer-position

     The position of the Org-roam buffer side window.  Valid values are
     ‘'left’, ‘'right’, ‘'top’, ‘'bottom’.

 -- User Option: org-roam-buffer-width

     Width of ‘org-roam-buffer’.  Has an effect only if
     ‘org-roam-buffer-position’ is ‘'left’ or ‘'right’.

 -- User Option: org-roam-buffer-height

     Height of ‘org-roam-buffer’.  Has an effect only if
     ‘org-roam-buffer-position’ is ‘'top’ or ‘'bottom’.

 -- User Option: org-roam-buffer-window-parameters

     Additional window parameters for the org-roam-buffer side window.

     For example one can prevent the window from being deleted when
     calling ‘delete-other-windows’, by setting it with the following:

     ‘(setq org-roam-buffer-window-parameters '((no-delete-other-windows
     . t)))’

19.3 Org-roam Files
===================

Org-roam files are created and prefilled using Org-roam’s templating
system.  The templating system is customizable (see *note The Templating
System::).


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Org-roam Faces,  Prev: Org-roam Files,  Up: Concepts and Configuration

19.4 Org-roam Faces
===================

Org-roam introduces several faces to distinguish links within the same
buffer.  These faces are enabled by default in Org-roam notes.

 -- User Option: org-roam-link-use-custom-faces

     When ‘t’, use custom faces only inside Org-roam notes.  When
     ‘everywhere’, the custom face is applied additionally to non
     Org-roam notes.  When ‘nil’, do not use Org-roam’s custom faces.

   The ‘org-roam-link’ face is the face applied to links to other
Org-roam files.  This distinguishes internal links from external links
(e.g.  external web links).

   The ‘org-roam-link-current’ face corresponds to links to the same
file it is in.

   The ‘org-roam-link-invalid’ face is applied to links that are broken.
These are links to files or IDs that cannot be found.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Inserting Links,  Next: Completions,  Prev: Concepts and Configuration,  Up: Top

20 Inserting Links
******************

The preferred mode of linking is via ‘file’ links to files, and ‘id’
links for headlines.  This maintains the strongest compatibility with
Org-mode, ensuring that the links still function without Org-roam, and
work well exporting to other backends.

   ‘file’ links can be inserted via ‘org-roam-insert’.  Links to
headlines can be inserted by navigating to the desired headline and
calling ‘org-store-link’.  This will create an ID for the headline if it
does not already exist, and populate the Org-roam database.  The link
can then be inserted via ‘org-insert-link’.

   An alternative mode of insertion is using Org-roam’s ‘roam’ links.
Org-roam registers this link type, and interprets the path as follows:

   • ‘[[roam:title]]’links to an Org-roam file with title or alias
     “title”

   • ‘[[roam:*headline]]’links to the headline “headline” in the current
     Org-roam file

   • ‘[[roam:title*headline]]’links to the headline “headline” in the
     Org-roam file with title or alias “title”

 -- User Option: org-roam-link-title-format

     To distinguish between org-roam links and regular links, one may
     choose to use special indicators for Org-roam links.  Defaults to
     ‘"%s"’.

     If your version of Org is at least ‘9.2’, consider styling the link
     differently, by customizing the ‘org-roam-link’, and
     ‘org-roam-link-current’ faces.

 -- User Option: org-roam-link-auto-replace

     When non-nil, ‘roam’ links will be replaced with ‘file’ or ‘id’
     links when they are navigated to, and on file save, when a match is
     found.  This is desirable to maintain compatibility with vanilla
     Org, but resolved links are harder to edit.  Defaults to ‘t’.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Completions,  Next: Navigating Around,  Prev: Inserting Links,  Up: Top

21 Completions
**************

Completions for Org-roam are provided via ‘completion-at-point’.
Completion suggestions are implemented as separate functions.  Org-roam
installs all functions in ‘org-roam-completion-functions’ to
‘completion-at-point-functions’.

 -- Variable: org-roam-completion-functions

     The list of functions to be used with ‘completion-at-point’.

 -- User Option: org-roam-completion-ignore-case

     When non-nil, the ‘roam’ link completions are ignore case.  For
     example, calling ‘completion-at-point’ within ‘[[roam:fo]]’ will
     present a completion for a file with title “Foo”.  Defaults to ‘t’.

   To use the completions from Org-roam with ‘company-mode’, prepend
‘company-capf’ to variable ‘company-backends’.

* Link Completion::
* Tag Completion::


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Link Completion,  Next: Tag Completion,  Up: Completions

21.1 Link Completion
====================

‘roam’ links support auto-completion via ‘completion-at-point’: simply
call ‘M-x completion-at-point’ within a roam link.  That is, where the
‘|’ character represents the cursor:

   • ‘[[|]]’: completes for a file title

   • ‘[[roam:|]]’: completes for a file title

   • ‘[[*|]]’: completes for a headline within this file

   • ‘[[foo*|]]’: completes a headline within the file with title “foo”

   • ‘[[roam:foo*|]]’ completes a headline within the file with title
     “foo”

   If you don’t see the literal display of your links like the above
examples, call ‘M-x org-toggle-link-display’

   Completions account for the current input.  For example, for
‘[[f|]]’, the completions (by default) only show for files with titles
that start with “f”.

 -- Function: org-roam-link-complete-at-point

     Do appropriate completion for the link at point.

* Link Completions Everywhere::


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Link Completions Everywhere,  Up: Link Completion

21.1.1 Link Completions Everywhere
----------------------------------

Org-roam is able to provide completions from the current word at point,
enabling as-you-type link completions.  However, this is disabled by
default: the author believes that linking should be a deliberate action
and linking should be performed with great care.

   Setting ‘org-roam-completion-everywhere’ to ‘t’ will enable
word-at-point completions.

 -- User Option: org-roam-completion-everywhere

     If non-nil, provide completions from the current word at point.
     That is, in the scenario ‘this is a sent|’, calling
     ‘completion-at-point’ will show completions for titles that begin
     with “sent”.

21.2 Tag Completion
===================

Org-roam facilitates the insertion of existing tags via
‘completion-at-point’.

   That is, suppose you have notes with tags “foo”, and “bar”.  Now, in
a note, if you’re on a line beginning with ‘#+roam_tags:’, completions
for these will appear as-you-type if they match.

   This functionality is implemented in
‘org-roam-complete-tags-at-point’.

22.1 Index File
===============

As your collection grows, you might want to create an index where you
keep links to your main files.

   In Org-roam, you can define the path to your index file by setting
‘org-roam-index-file’.

 -- Variable: org-roam-index-file

     Path to the Org-roam index file.

     The path can be a string or a function.  If it is a string, it
     should be the path (absolute or relative to ‘org-roam-directory’)
     to the index file.  If it is is a function, the function should
     return the path to the index file.  Otherwise, the index is assumed
     to be a note in ‘org-roam-index’ whose title is ‘"Index"’.

 -- Function: org-roam-find-index

     Opens the Index file in the current ‘org-roam-directory’.

23 Encryption
*************

One may wish to keep private, encrypted files.  Org-roam supports
encryption (via GPG), which can be enabled for all new files by setting
‘org-roam-encrypt-files’ to ‘t’.  When enabled, new files are created
with the ‘.org.gpg’ extension and decryption are handled automatically
by EasyPG.

   Note that Emacs will prompt for a password for encrypted files during
cache updates if it requires reading the encrypted file.  To reduce the
number of password prompts, you may wish to cache the password.

 -- User Option: org-roam-encrypt-files

     Whether to encrypt new files.  If true, create files with .org.gpg
     extension.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Graphing,  Next: Minibuffer Completion,  Prev: Encryption (1),  Up: Top

24 Graphing
***********

Org-roam provides graphing capabilities to explore interconnections
between notes.  This is done by performing SQL queries and generating
images using Graphviz (https://graphviz.org/).  The graph can also be
navigated: see *note Roam Protocol::.

   The entry point to graph creation is ‘org-roam-graph’.

 -- Function: org-roam-graph & optional arg file node-query

     Build and possibly display a graph for FILE from NODE-QUERY.  If
     FILE is nil, default to current buffer’s file name.  ARG may be any
     of the following values:

        • ‘nil’ show the graph.

        • ‘C-u’ show the graph for FILE.

        • ‘C-u N’ show the graph for FILE limiting nodes to N steps.

        • ‘C-u C-u’ build the graph.

        • ‘C-u -’ build the graph for FILE.

        • ‘C-u -N’ build the graph for FILE limiting nodes to N steps.

 -- User Option: org-roam-graph-executable

     Path to the graphing executable (in this case, Graphviz).  Set this
     if Org-roam is unable to find the Graphviz executable on your
     system.

     You may also choose to use ‘neato’ in place of ‘dot’, which
     generates a more compact graph layout.

 -- User Option: org-roam-graph-viewer

     Org-roam defaults to using Firefox (located on PATH) to view the
     SVG, but you may choose to set it to:

        • A string, which is a path to the program used

        • a function accepting a single argument: the graph file path.

     ‘nil’ uses ‘view-file’ to view the graph.

     If you are using WSL2 and would like to open the graph in Windows,
     you can use the second option to set the browser and network file
     path:

          (setq org-roam-graph-viewer
              (lambda (file)
                (let ((org-roam-graph-viewer "/mnt/c/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/firefox.exe"))

     If value is a string, the string is the only matcher.

     If value is a list, all file paths matching any of the strings are
     excluded.

     (setq org-roam-graph-exclude-matcher '("private" "dailies"))

File: org-roam.info,  Node: Installation (1),  Next: The roam-file protocol,  Up: Roam Protocol

26.1 Installation
=================

To enable Org-roam’s protocol extensions, you have to add the following
to your init file:

     (require 'org-roam-protocol)

   The instructions for setting up ‘org-protocol’ are reproduced below.

   We will also need to create a desktop application for ‘emacsclient’.
The instructions for various platforms are shown below.

   For Linux users, create a desktop application in
‘~/.local/share/applications/org-protocol.desktop’:

     [Desktop Entry]
     Name=Org-Protocol
     Exec=emacsclient %u
     Icon=emacs-icon
     Type=Application
     Terminal=false
     MimeType=x-scheme-handler/org-protocol

   Associate ‘org-protocol://’ links with the desktop application by
running in your shell:

     xdg-mime default org-protocol.desktop x-scheme-handler/org-protocol

   To disable the “confirm” prompt in Chrome, you can also make Chrome
show a checkbox to tick, so that the ‘Org-Protocol Client’ app will be
used without confirmation.  To do this, run in a shell:

     sudo mkdir -p /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/
     sudo tee /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/external_protocol_dialog.json >/dev/null <<'EOF'
     {
       "ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox": true
     }
     EOF
     sudo chmod 644 /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/external_protocol_dialog.json

   and then restart Chrome (for example, by navigating to
<chrome://restart>) to make the new policy take effect.

   See here (https://www.chromium.org/administrators/linux-quick-start)
for more info on the ‘/etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed’ directory and
here
(https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox)
for information on the ‘ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox’
policy.

   For MacOS, we need to create our own application.

   • Launch Script Editor

   • Use the following script, paying attention to the path to
     ‘emacsclient’:

     on open location this_URL
         set EC to "/usr/local/bin/emacsclient --no-wait "
         set filePath to quoted form of this_URL
         do shell script EC & filePath
         tell application "Emacs" to activate
     end open location

   • Save the script in ‘/Applications/OrgProtocolClient.app’, changing
     the script type to “Application”, rather than “Script”.

   • Edit ‘/Applications/OrgProtocolClient.app/Contents/Info.plist’,
     adding the following before the last ‘</dict>’ tag:

     <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
     <array>
       <dict>
         <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
         <string>org-protocol handler</string>
         <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
         <array>
           <string>org-protocol</string>
         </array>
       </dict>
     </array>

   • Save the file, and run the ‘OrgProtocolClient.app’ to register the
     protocol.

   To disable the “confirm” prompt in Chrome, you can also make Chrome
show a checkbox to tick, so that the ‘OrgProtocol’ app will be used
without confirmation.  To do this, run in a shell:

     defaults write com.google.Chrome ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox -bool true

   If you’re using Emacs Mac Port
(https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport), it registered its
‘Emacs.app‘ as the default handler for the URL scheme ‘org-protocol‘.
To make ‘OrgProtocol.app’ the default handler instead, run:

     defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure LSHandlers -array-add \
     '{"LSHandlerPreferredVersions" = { "LSHandlerRoleAll" = "-"; }; LSHandlerRoleAll = "org.yourusername.OrgProtocol"; LSHandlerURLScheme = "org-protocol";}'

   Then restart your computer.

   For Windows, create a temporary ‘org-protocol.reg’ file:

     REGEDIT4

     [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\org-protocol]
     @="URL:Org Protocol"
     "URL Protocol"=""
     [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\org-protocol\shell]
     [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\org-protocol\shell\open]
     [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\org-protocol\shell\open\command]
     @="\"C:\\Windows\\System32\\wsl.exe\" emacsclient \"%1\""

   The above will forward the protocol to WSL.  If you run Emacs
natively on Windows, replace the last line with:

     @="\"c:\\path\\to\\emacs\\bin\\emacsclientw.exe\"  \"%1\""

   After executing the .reg file, the protocol is registered and you can
delete the file.

26.2 The roam-file protocol
===========================

This is a simple protocol that opens the path specified by the ‘file’
key (e.g.  ‘org-protocol://roam-file?file=/tmp/file.org’).  This is used
in the generated graph.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: The roam-ref protocol,  Prev: The roam-file protocol,  Up: Roam Protocol

26.3 The roam-ref protocol
==========================

This protocol finds or creates a new note with a given ‘roam_key’:

 [image src="images/roam-ref.gif" ]

   To use this, create the following bookmarklet
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) in your browser:

     javascript:location.href =
         'org-protocol://roam-ref?template=r&ref='
         + encodeURIComponent(location.href)
         + '&title='
         + encodeURIComponent(document.title)
         + '&body='
         + encodeURIComponent(window.getSelection())

   or as a keybinding in ‘qutebrowser’ in , using the ‘config.py’ file
(see Configuring qutebrowser
(https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/help/configuring.asciidoc)):

     config.bind("<Ctrl-r>", "open javascript:location.href='org-protocol://roam-ref?template=r&ref='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)")

   where ‘template’ is the template key for a template in
‘org-roam-capture-ref-templates’ (see *note The Templating System::).
These templates should contain a ‘#+roam_key: ${ref}’ in it.

File: org-roam.info,  Node: Configuration,  Next: Capturing and finding daily-notes,  Up: Daily-notes

27.1 Configuration
==================

For ‘org-roam-dailies’ to work, you need to define two variables:

 -- Variable: ‘org-roam-dailies-directory’

     Path to daily-notes.

 -- Variable: ‘org-roam-dailies-capture-templates’

     Capture templates for daily-notes in Org-roam.

   Here is a sane default configuration:

     (setq org-roam-dailies-directory "daily/")

     (setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates
           '(("d" "default" entry
              #'org-roam-capture--get-point
              "* %?"
              :file-name "daily/%<%Y-%m-%d>"
              :head "#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d>\n\n")))

   Make sure that ‘org-roam-dailies-directory’ appears in ‘:file-name’
for your notes to be recognized as daily-notes.  You can have different
templates placing their notes in different directories, but the one in
‘org-roam-dailies-directory’ will be considered as the main one in
commands.

   See *note The Templating System:: for creating new templates.
‘org-roam-dailies’ provides an extra ‘:olp’ option which allows
specifying the outline-path to a heading:

     (setq org-roam-dailies-capture-templates
           '(("l" "lab" entry
              #'org-roam-capture--get-point
              "* %?"
              :file-name "daily/%<%Y-%m-%d>"
              :head "#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d>\n"
              :olp ("Lab notes"))

             ("j" "journal" entry
              #'org-roam-capture--get-point
              "* %?"
              :file-name "daily/%<%Y-%m-%d>"
              :head "#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d>\n"
              :olp ("Journal"))))

   The template ‘l’ will put its notes under the heading ‘Lab notes’,
and the template ‘j’ will put its notes under the heading ‘Journal’.

27.2 Capturing and finding daily-notes
======================================

 -- Function: ‘org-roam-dailies-capture-today’ &optional goto

     Create an entry in the daily note for today.

     When ‘goto’ is non-nil, go to the note without creating an entry.

 -- Function: ‘org-roam-dailies-find-today’

     Find the daily note for today, creating it if necessary.

   There are variants of those commands for ‘-yesterday’ and
‘-tomorrow’:

 -- Function: ‘org-roam-dailies-capture-yesterday’ n &optional goto

     Create an entry in the daily note for yesteday.

     With numeric argument ‘n’, use the daily note ‘n’ days in the past.

 -- Function: ‘org-roam-dailies-find-yesterday’

     With numeric argument N, use the daily-note N days in the future.

   There are also commands which allow you to use Emacs’s ‘calendar’ to
find the date

 -- Function: ‘org-roam-dailies-capture-date’

     Create an entry in the daily note for a date using the calendar.

     Prefer past dates, unless ‘prefer-future’ is non-nil.

     With a ’C-u’ prefix or when ‘goto’ is non-nil, go the note without
     creating an entry.

 -- Function: ‘org-roam-dailies-find-date’

     Find the daily note for a date using the calendar, creating it if
     necessary.

     Prefer past dates, unless ‘prefer-future’ is non-nil.

28 Diagnosing and Repairing Files
*********************************

Org-roam provides a utility for diagnosing and repairing problematic
files via ‘org-roam-doctor’.  By default, ‘org-roam-doctor’ runs the
check on the current Org-roam file.  To run the check only for all
Org-roam files, run ‘C-u M-x org-roam-doctor’, but note that this may
take some time.

 -- Function: org-roam-doctor &optional this-buffer

     Perform a check on Org-roam files to ensure cleanliness.  If
     THIS-BUFFER, run the check only for the current buffer.

   The checks run are defined in ‘org-roam-doctor--checkers’.  By
default, there are checkers for broken links and invalid ‘#+roam_*’
properties.

   Each checker is an instance of ‘org-roam-doctor-checker’.  To define
a checker, use ‘make-org-roam-doctor-checker’.  Here is a sample
definition:

     (make-org-roam-doctor-checker
         :name 'org-roam-doctor-broken-links
         :description "Fix broken links."
         :actions '(("d" . ("Unlink" . org-roam-doctor--remove-link))
                    ("r" . ("Replace link" . org-roam-doctor--replace-link))
                    ("R" . ("Replace link (keep label)" . org-roam-doctor--replace-link-keep-label))))

   The ‘:name’ property is the name of the function run.  The function
takes in the Org parse tree, and returns a list of ‘(point
error-message)’.  ‘:description’ is a short description of what the
checker does.  ‘:actions’ is an alist containing elements of the form
‘(char . (prompt . function))’.  These actions are defined per checker,
to perform autofixes for the errors.  For each error detected,
‘org-roam-doctor’ will move the point to the current error, and pop-up a
help window displaying the error message, as well as the list of actions
that can be taken provided in ‘:actions’.

29 Finding Unlinked References
******************************

Unlinked references are occurrences of strings of text that exactly
match the title or alias of an existing note in the Org-roam database.
Org-roam provides facilities for discovering these unlinked references,
so one may decide whether to convert them into links.

   To use this feature, simply call ‘M-x org-roam-unlinked-references’
from within an Org-roam note.  Internally, Org-roam uses ripgrep
(https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and a clever PCRE regex to find
occurrences of the title or aliases of the currently open note in all
Org-roam files.  Hence, this requires a version of ripgrep that is
compiled with PCRE support.

     NOTE: Since ripgrep cannot read encrypted files, this function
     cannot find unlinked references within encrypted files.

File: org-roam.info,  Node: Garbage Collection,  Prev: Profiling Key Operations,  Up: Performance Optimization

30.2 Garbage Collection
=======================

During the cache-build process, Org-roam generates a lot of in-memory
data-structures (such as the Org file’s AST), which are discarded after
use.  These structures are garbage collected at regular intervals (see
*note info:elisp#Garbage Collection: (elisp)Garbage Collection.).

   Org-roam provides the option ‘org-roam-db-gc-threshold’ to
temporarily change the threshold value for GC to be triggered during
these memory-intensive operations.  To reduce the number of garbage
collection processes, one may set ‘org-roam-db-gc-threshold’ to a high
value (such as ‘most-positive-fixnum’):

     (setq org-roam-db-gc-threshold most-positive-fixnum)

31.2.1 Browsing History with winner-mode
----------------------------------------

‘winner-mode’ is a global minor mode that allows one to undo and redo
changes in the window configuration.  It is included with GNU Emacs
since version 20.

   ‘winner-mode’ can be used as a simple version of browser history for
Org-roam.  Each click through org-roam links (from both Org files and
the backlinks buffer) causes changes in window configuration, which can
be undone and redone using ‘winner-mode’.  To use ‘winner-mode’, simply
enable it, and bind the appropriate interactive functions:

     (winner-mode +1)
     (define-key winner-mode-map (kbd "<M-left>") #'winner-undo)
     (define-key winner-mode-map (kbd "<M-right>") #'winner-redo)



File: org-roam.info,  Node: Versioning Notes,  Next: Full-text search interface with Deft,  Prev: Browsing History with winner-mode,  Up: Ecosystem

31.2.2 Versioning Notes
-----------------------

Since Org-roam notes are just plain text, it is trivial to track changes
in your notes database using version control systems such as Git
(https://git-scm.com/).  Simply initialize ‘org-roam-directory’ as a Git
repository, and commit your files at regular or appropriate intervals.
Magit (https://magit.vc/) is a great interface to Git within Emacs.

   In addition, it may be useful to observe how a particular note has
evolved, by looking at the file history.  Git-timemachine
(https://gitlab.com/pidu/git-timemachine) allows you to visit historic
versions of a tracked Org-roam note.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Full-text search interface with Deft,  Next: Org-journal,  Prev: Versioning Notes,  Up: Ecosystem

31.2.3 Full-text search interface with Deft
-------------------------------------------

Deft (https://jblevins.org/projects/deft/) provides a nice interface for
browsing and filtering org-roam notes.

     (use-package deft
       :after org
       :bind
       ("C-c n d" . deft)
       :custom
       (deft-recursive t)
       (deft-use-filter-string-for-filename t)
       (deft-default-extension "org")
       (deft-directory "/path/to/org-roam-files/"))

   If the title of the Org file is not the first line, you might not get
nice titles.  You may choose to patch this to use ‘org-roam’’s
functionality.  Here I’m using el-patch
(https://github.com/raxod502/el-patch):

     (use-package el-patch
       :straight (:host github
                  :repo "raxod502/el-patch"
                  :branch "develop"))

     (eval-when-compile
       (require 'el-patch))

   The Deft interface can slow down quickly when the number of files get
huge.  Notdeft (https://github.com/hasu/notdeft) is a fork of Deft that
uses an external search engine and indexer.


File: org-roam.info,  Node: Org-journal,  Next: Note-taking Add-ons,  Prev: Full-text search interface with Deft,  Up: Ecosystem

31.2.4 Org-journal
------------------

Org-journal (https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal) provides journaling
capabilities to Org-mode.  A lot of its functionalities have been
incorporated into Org-roam under the name *note ‘org-roam-dailies’:
Daily-notes.  It remains a good tool if you want to isolate your verbose
journal entries from the ideas you would write on a scratchpad.

     (use-package org-journal
       :bind
       ("C-c n j" . org-journal-new-entry)
       :custom
       (org-journal-date-prefix "#+title: ")
       (org-journal-file-format "%Y-%m-%d.org")
       (org-journal-dir "/path/to/journal/files/")

This helps you manage your bibliographic notes under ‘org-roam’.

   For example, though helm-bibtex provides the ability to visit notes
for bibliographic entries, org-roam-bibtex extends it with the ability
to visit the file with the right ‘#+roam_key’.

32.1 How do I have more than one Org-roam directory?
====================================================

Emacs supports directory-local variables, allowing the value of
‘org-roam-directory’ to be different in different directories.  It does
this by checking for a file named ‘.dir-locals.el’.

   To add support for multiple directories, override the
‘org-roam-directory’ variable using directory-local variables.  This is
what ‘.dir-locals.el’ may contain:

     ((nil . ((org-roam-directory . (expand-file-name "."))
              (org-roam-db-location . (expand-file-name "./org-roam.db")))))

   All files within that directory will be treated as their own separate
set of Org-roam files.  Remember to run ‘org-roam-db-build-cache’ from a
file within that directory, at least once.

32.2 How do I migrate from Roam Research?
=========================================

Fabio has produced a command-line tool that converts markdown files
exported from Roam Research into Org-roam compatible markdown.  More
instructions are provided in the repository
(https://github.com/fabioberger/roam-migration).

32.3 How do I create a note whose title already matches one of the candidates?
==============================================================================

This situation arises when, for example, one would like to create a note
titled “bar” when “barricade” already exists.

   The solution is dependent on the mini-buffer completion framework in
use.  Here are the solutions:

   • Ivycall ‘ivy-immediate-done’, typically bound to ‘C-M-j’.
     Alternatively, set ‘ivy-use-selectable-prompt’ to ‘t’, so that
     “bar” is now selectable.

   • HelmOrg-roam should provide a selectable “[?]  bar” candidate at
     the top of the candidate list.
