	* multishell/multishell.el: Require cl-lib when compiling for cl-letf
	macro.

2020-10-29  Ken Manheimer  <ken.manheimer@gmail.com>

	* packages/multishell: Fix dumb errors in version statements.

	It's actually 1.1.8. The important Version: header was left at 1.1.7 and
	my Change Log had it at 1.1.9 (sowing confusion). Anyway, the prior
	1.1.7 commit that had my misguided requires arrangement, wasn't
	displaced by the commit that rectified it. It now will be by correcting
	the Version: header.

2020-10-28  Ken Manheimer  <ken.manheimer@gmail.com>

	* packages/multishell: require multishell from multishell-list,

	Remove now unnecessary autoload cookies.  Update version number so these 
	are the revisions that are released.

2020-10-28  Ken Manheimer  <ken.manheimer@gmail.com>

	* packages/multishell: require multishell-list from multishell,

	Add some autoloads for inter-dependencies and update version number.

	* multishell.el: Update copyright dates, include version log entries. 
	Include autoloads for functions needed by multishell-list.
	(multishell-pop-to-shell): Refine docstring.
	(multishell-start-shell-in-buffer): Change argument name, settling
	FIXME. Handle absence of target remote directory gracefully.

	* multishell-list.el: Update copyright dates.

	* multishell/multishell.el: Minor comment/doc tweaks

2018-02-27  Stefan Monnier  <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* packages/multishell: Break cyclic require; use lexical and cl-lib

	* multishell.el: Don't require 'multishell-list'.
	(multishell-implement-command-key-choice): Rewrite so the compiler 
	understands that multishell-activate-command-key is only used if it's
	bound.
	(multishell-track-dirchange): Remove unused var 'name'.

	* multishell-list.el: Require 'multishell' in the normal way.
	(multishell-list-delete): Don't pass unused 'arg'.
	(multishell-list--collate-row-strings-as-numbers): Rename from 
	multishell-collate-row-strings-as-numbers.
	(multishell-list-cull-dups): 'mapcar' => 'dolist'.
	(multishell-list): 'progv' => 'cl-progv'.

	Fix some quoting problems in doc strings

	Most of these are minor issues involving, e.g., quoting `like this' 
	instead of 'like this'.	 A few involve escaping ` and ' with a preceding
	\= when the characters should not be turned into curved single quotes.

	multishell - remove plain file copy to replace it with a subtree clone

2016-01-04  Ken Manheimer  <ken.manheimer@gmail.com>

	multishell - remove custom var
	multishell-non-interactive-process-buffers

	Multishell should only be concerned with shell-mode and shell-mode 
	derived buffers. Clarify that, and remove obsoleted 
	multishell-non-interactive-process-buffers. That var wasn't being 
	properly used, anyway - the residual var non-interactive-process-buffers 
	was mistakenly being used, it's now removed, too.

2016-01-04  Ken Manheimer  <ken.manheimer@gmail.com>

	multishell - refactor for name-then-path, and use a valid release
	number.

	Hopefully this update is out there before anyone gets used to the old 
	path-then-name format. (I haven't seen it in list-packages, but someone 
	indicated that it might be out.)

2016-01-04  Ken Manheimer  <ken.manheimer@gmail.com>

	multishell - V. 0. Change "multishell:" to "multishell-", use
	everywhere.

	For ELPA conformance.

	I'm also changing the version number to 0 to defer initial release. I 
	discovered a big, user-exposed change I want to make, and need to iron 
	it out before anyone gets used to the previous format.

2016-01-03  Ken Manheimer  <ken.manheimer@gmail.com>

	multishell.el - Remove (redundant) maintainer line, fix remote cd
	ordering.

	Also, remove redundant requires.

2016-01-03  Ken Manheimer  <ken.manheimer@gmail.com>

	multishell - Use actual email address, rather than obscured, in
	packaging.

	multishell - new package

	Author: Ken Manheimer <ken dot manheimer at gmail...> Version: 1.0.0 
	Maintainer: Ken Manheimer <ken dot manheimer at gmail...> Created: 1999
	-- first public availability Keywords: processes URL:
	https://github.com/kenmanheimer/EmacsUtils

	Commentary:

	Easily use and manage multiple shell buffers, including remote shells. 
	Fundamentally, multishell is the function `multishell:pop-to-shell -
	like pop-to-buffer - plus a keybinding. Together, they enable you to:

	* Get to the input point from wherever you are in a shell buffer,
	* ... or to a shell buffer if you're not currently in one.
	* Use universal arguments to launch and choose among alternate shell
	buffers,
	* ... and select which is default.
	* Prepend a path to a new shell name to launch a shell in that
	directory,
	* ... and use a path with Emacs tramp syntax to launch a remote shell.

	Customize-group `multishell` to select and activate a keybinding and set 
	various behaviors.

	See the pop-to-shell docstring for details.
