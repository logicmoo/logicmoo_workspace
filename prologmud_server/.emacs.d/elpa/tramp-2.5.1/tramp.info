TRAMP 2.5.1 User Manual
***********************

This file documents TRAMP 2.5.1, a remote file editing package for
Emacs.

   TRAMP stands for “Transparent Remote (file) Access, Multiple
Protocol”.  This package provides remote file editing, similar to Ange
FTP.

   The difference is that Ange FTP uses FTP to transfer files between
the local and the remote host, whereas TRAMP uses a combination of ‘rsh’
and ‘rcp’ or other work-alike programs, such as ‘ssh’/‘scp’.

   You can find the latest version of this document on the web at
<https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/>.

   There is a mailing list for TRAMP, available at
<tramp-devel@gnu.org>, and archived at the TRAMP Mail Archive
(https://lists.gnu.org/r/tramp-devel/).

1 An overview of TRAMP
**********************

TRAMP is for transparently accessing remote files from within Emacs.
TRAMP enables an easy, convenient, and consistent interface to remote
files as if they are local files.  TRAMP’s transparency extends to
editing, version control, and ‘dired’.

   TRAMP can access remote hosts using any number of access methods,
such as ‘rsh’, ‘rlogin’, ‘telnet’, and related programs.  If these
programs can successfully pass ASCII characters, TRAMP can use them.
TRAMP does not require or mandate 8-bit clean connections.

   TRAMP’s most common access method is through ‘ssh’, a more secure
alternative to ‘ftp’ and other older access methods.

   TRAMP on MS Windows operating systems is integrated with the PuTTY
package, and uses the ‘plink’ program.

   TRAMP mostly operates transparently in the background using the
connection programs.  As long as these programs enable remote login and
can use the terminal, TRAMP can adapt them for seamless and transparent
access.

   TRAMP temporarily transfers a remote file’s contents to the local
host editing and related operations.  TRAMP can also transfer files
between hosts using standard Emacs interfaces, a benefit of direct
integration of TRAMP in Emacs.

   TRAMP can transfer files using any number of available host programs
for remote files, such as ‘rcp’, ‘scp’, ‘rsync’ or (under MS Windows)
‘pscp’.  TRAMP provides easy ways to specify these programs and
customize them to specific files, hosts, or access methods.

   For faster small-size file transfers, TRAMP supports encoded
transfers directly through the shell using ‘mimencode’ or ‘uuencode’
provided such tools are available on the remote host.

TRAMP behind the scenes
.......................

Accessing a remote file through TRAMP entails a series of actions, many
of which are transparent to the user.  Yet some actions may require user
response (such as entering passwords or completing file names).  One
typical scenario, opening a file on a remote host, is presented here to
illustrate the steps involved:

   ‘C-x C-f’ to initiate find-file, enter part of the TRAMP file name,
then hit ‘<TAB>’ for completion.  If this is the first time connecting
to that host, here’s what happens:

   • TRAMP invokes ‘telnet HOST’ or ‘rsh HOST -l USER’ and establishes
     an external process to connect to the remote host.  TRAMP
     communicates with the process through an Emacs buffer, which also
     shows output from the remote host.

   • The remote host may prompt for a login name (for ‘telnet’, for
     example) in the buffer.  If on the other hand, the login name was
     included in the file name portion, TRAMP sends the login name
     followed by a newline.

   • The remote host may then prompt for a password or passphrase (for
     ‘rsh’ or for ‘telnet’).  TRAMP displays the password prompt in the
     minibuffer.  TRAMP then sends whatever is entered to the remote
     host, followed by a newline.

   • TRAMP now waits for either the shell prompt or a failed login
     message.

     If TRAMP does not receive any messages within a timeout period (a
     minute, for example), then TRAMP responds with an error message
     about not finding the remote shell prompt.  If there are any
     messages from the remote host, TRAMP displays them in the buffer.

     For any ‘login failed’ message from the remote host, TRAMP aborts
     the login attempt, and repeats the login steps.

   • Upon successful login, if TRAMP recognizes the shell prompt from
     the remote host, TRAMP prepares the shell environment by turning
     off echoing, setting the shell prompt, and other housekeeping
     chores.

     *Note* that for the remote shell, TRAMP invokes ‘/bin/sh’.  The
     remote host must recognize ‘exec /bin/sh’ and execute the
     appropriate shell.  This shell must support Bourne shell syntax.

   • TRAMP executes ‘cd’ and ‘ls’ commands to find which files exist on
     the remote host.  TRAMP sometimes uses ‘echo’ with globbing.  TRAMP
     checks if a file or directory is writable with ‘test’.  After each
     command, TRAMP parses the output from the remote host for
     completing the next operation.

   • After remote file name completion, TRAMP transfers the file
     contents from the remote host.

     For inline transfers, TRAMP sends a command, such as ‘mimencode -b
     /path/to/remote/file’, waits until the output has accumulated in
     the buffer, then decodes that output to produce the file’s
     contents.

     For external transfers, TRAMP sends a command as follows:
          rcp user@host:/path/to/remote/file /tmp/tramp.4711
     TRAMP reads the local temporary file ‘/tmp/tramp.4711’ into a
     buffer, and then deletes the temporary file.

   • Edit, modify, change the buffer contents as normal, and then save
     the buffer with ‘C-x C-s’.

   • TRAMP transfers the buffer contents to the remote host in a reverse
     of the process using the appropriate inline or external program.

   I hope this has provided you with a basic overview of what happens
behind the scenes when you open a file with TRAMP.

2 Obtaining TRAMP
*****************

TRAMP is included as part of Emacs (since Emacs 22.1).

   TRAMP is also freely packaged for download on the Internet at
<https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/tramp/>.  The version number of TRAMP can be
obtained by the variable ‘tramp-version’.  For released TRAMP versions,
this is a three-number string like “2.4.5”.

   A TRAMP release, which is packaged with Emacs, could differ slightly
from the corresponding standalone release.  This is because it isn’t
always possible to synchronize release dates between Emacs and TRAMP.
Such version numbers have the Emacs version number as suffix, like
“2.4.5.27.2”.  This means TRAMP 2.4.5 as integrated in Emacs 27.2.  A
complete list of TRAMP versions packaged with Emacs can be retrieved by

     (assoc 'Tramp customize-package-emacs-version-alist)

   TRAMP is also available as GNU ELPA (https://elpa.gnu.org) package.
Besides the standalone releases, further minor versions of TRAMP will
appear on GNU ELPA, until the next TRAMP release appears.  These minor
versions have a four-number string, like “2.4.5.1”.

   TRAMP development versions are available on Git servers.  Development
versions contain new and incomplete features.  The development version
of TRAMP is always the version number of the next release, plus the
suffix “-pre”, like “2.4.4-pre”.

   One way to obtain TRAMP from the Git server is to visit the Savannah
project page at the following URL and then clicking on the Git link in
the navigation bar at the top.

<https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/tramp/>

Another way is to follow the terminal session below:

     $ cd ~/emacs
     $ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/tramp.git

From behind a proxy:

     $ git config --global http.proxy http://user:pwd@proxy.server.com:8080
     $ git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/r/tramp.git

TRAMP developers:

     $ git clone login@git.sv.gnu.org:/srv/git/tramp.git

After one of the above commands, ‘~/emacs/tramp’ will containing the
latest version of TRAMP.

To fetch updates from the repository, use ‘git pull’:

     $ cd ~/emacs/tramp
     $ git pull

Run ‘autoconf’ as follows to generate an up-to-date ‘configure’ script:

     $ cd ~/emacs/tramp
     $ autoconf

   See the file ‘INSTALL’ in that directory for further information on
how to install TRAMP.

3 Short introduction how to use TRAMP
*************************************

TRAMP extends the Emacs file name syntax by adding a remote component.
A remote file name always looks like ‘/method:user@host:/path/to/file’.

   You can use remote files exactly like ordinary files, that means you
can open a file or directory by ‘C-x C-f /method:user@host:/path/to/file
<RET>’, edit the file, and save it.  You can also mix local files and
remote files in file operations with two arguments, like ‘copy-file’ or
‘rename-file’.  And finally, you can even run processes on a remote
host, when the buffer you call the process from has a remote
‘default-directory’.

3.1 File name syntax
====================

Remote file names have ‘method’, ‘user’ and ‘host’ parts prepended.  All
of them, and also the local file name part, are optional, in case of a
missing part a default value is assumed.  The default value for an empty
local file name part is the remote user’s home directory.  The shortest
remote file name is thus ‘/-::’.  The ‘-’ notation for the default
method is used for syntactical reasons, *note Default Method::.

   The ‘method’ part describes the connection method used to reach the
remote host, see below.

   The ‘user’ part is the user name for accessing the remote host.  For
the ‘smb’ method, this could also require a domain name, in which case
it is written as ‘user%domain’.

   The ‘host’ part must be a host name which can be resolved on your
local host.  It could be a short host name, a fully qualified domain
name, an IPv4 or IPv6 address, *note File name syntax::.  Some
connection methods also support a notation for the port to be used, in
which case it is written as ‘host#port’.

3.2 Using ‘ssh’ and ‘plink’
===========================

If your local host runs an SSH client, and the remote host runs an SSH
server, the simplest remote file name is ‘/ssh:user@host:/path/to/file’.
The remote file name ‘/ssh::’ opens a remote connection to yourself on
the local host, and is often used for testing TRAMP.

   On MS Windows, PuTTY is often used as the SSH client.  Its ‘plink’
method can be used there to open a connection to a remote host running
an ‘ssh’ server: ‘/plink:user@host:/path/to/file’.

3.3 Using ‘su’, ‘sudo’, ‘doas’ and ‘sg’
=======================================

Sometimes, it is necessary to work on your local host under different
permissions.  For this, you can use the ‘su’ or ‘sudo’ connection
method.  On OpenBSD systems, the ‘doas’ connection method offers the
same functionality.  These methods use ‘root’ as default user name and
the return value of ‘(system-name)’ as default host name.  Therefore, it
is convenient to open a file as ‘/sudo::/path/to/file’.

   The method ‘sg’ stands for “switch group”; here the user name is used
as the group to change to.  The default host name is the same.

3.4 Combining ‘ssh’ or ‘plink’ with ‘su’, ‘sudo’ or ‘doas’
==========================================================

If the ‘su’, ‘sudo’ or ‘doas’ option should be performed on another
host, it can be comnbined with a leading ‘ssh’ or ‘plink’ option.  That
means that TRAMP connects first to the other host with
non-administrative credentials, and changes to administrative
credentials on that host afterwards.  In a simple case, the syntax looks
like ‘/ssh:user@host|sudo::/path/to/file’.  *Note Ad-hoc multi-hops::.

3.5 Using ‘sudoedit’
====================

The ‘sudoedit’ method is similar to the ‘sudo’ method.  However, it is a
different implementation: it does not keep an open session running in
the background.  This is for security reasons; on the backside this
method has worse performance than the ‘sudo’ method, it is restricted to
‘localhost’ only, and it does not support external processes.

3.6 Using ‘smbclient’
=====================

In order to access a remote MS Windows host or Samba server, the
‘smbclient’ client is used.  The remote file name syntax is
‘/smb:user%domain@host:/path/to/file’.  The first part of the local file
name is the share exported by the remote host, ‘path’ in this example.

3.7 Using GVFS-based methods
============================

On systems which have GVFS (the GNOME Virtual File System) installed,
its offered methods can be used by TRAMP.  Examples are
‘/sftp:user@host:/path/to/file’, ‘/afp:user@host:/path/to/file’
(accessing Apple’s AFP file system), ‘/dav:user@host:/path/to/file’,
‘/davs:user@host:/path/to/file’ (for WebDAV shares) and
‘/mtp:device:/path/to/file’ (for media devices).

3.8 Using GNOME Online Accounts based methods
=============================================

GVFS-based methods also include GNOME Online Accounts, which support the
‘Files’ service.  These are the Google Drive file system, and the
OwnCloud/NextCloud file system.  The file name syntax here is always
‘/gdrive:john.doe@gmail.com:/path/to/file’ (‘john.doe@gmail.com’ stands
here for your Google Drive account), or
‘/nextcloud:user@host#8081:/path/to/file’ (‘8081’ stands for the port
number) for OwnCloud/NextCloud files.

3.9 Using FUSE-based methods
============================

FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) allows users to mount a virtual file
system.  It is also used by GVFS internally, but here we discuss methods
which do not use the GVFS API.

   A convenient way to access system storages is the ‘rclone’ program.
If you have configured a storage in ‘rclone’ under a name ‘storage’ (for
example), you can access it via the remote file name syntax
‘/rclone:storage:/path/to/file’.  User names are not needed.

   On local hosts which have installed the ‘sshfs’ client for mounting a
file system based on ‘sftp’, this method can be used.  All remote files
are available via the local mount point.  TRAMP aids in mounting the
file system if it isn’t mounted yet, and it supports the access with the
usual file name syntax ‘/sshfs:user@host:/path/to/file’.

3.10 Using Android
==================

An Android device, which is connected via USB to your local host, can be
accessed via the ‘adb’ command.  No user or host name is needed.  The
file name syntax is ‘/adb::/path/to/file’.

4 Configuring TRAMP
*******************

TRAMP is initially configured to use the ‘scp’ program to connect to the
remote host.  Just type ‘C-x C-f’ and then enter file name
‘/scp:user@host:/path/to/file’.  For details, *Note Default Method::,
*Note Default User::, *Note Default Host::.

   For problems related to the behavior of the remote shell, *Note
Remote shell setup::.

   For changing the connection type and file access method from the
defaults to one of several other options, *Note Connection types::.

   *Note* that some user options described in these examples are not
auto loaded by Emacs.  All examples require TRAMP to be installed and
loaded:

     (customize-set-variable 'tramp-verbose 6 "Enable remote command traces")

   For functions used to configure TRAMP, the following clause may be
used in your init file:

File: tramp.info,  Node: Connection types,  Next: Inline methods,  Up: Configuration

4.1 Types of connections to remote hosts
========================================

“Inline method” and “external method” are the two basic types of access
methods.  While they both use the same remote shell access programs,
such as ‘rsh’, ‘ssh’, or ‘telnet’, they differ in the file access
methods.  Choosing the right method becomes important for editing files,
transferring large files, or operating on a large number of files.

   The performance of the external methods is generally better than that
of the inline methods, at least for large files.  This is caused by the
need to encode and decode the data when transferring inline.

   The one exception to this rule are the ‘scp’-based access methods.
While these methods do see better performance when actually transferring
files, the overhead of the cryptographic negotiation at startup may
drown out the improvement in file transfer times.

   External methods should be configured in such a way that they don’t
require a password (with ‘ssh-agent’, or similar).  Modern ‘scp’
implementations offer options to reuse existing ‘ssh’ connections, which
TRAMP enables by default if available.  If that is not possible, you
should consider *note Password handling::, otherwise you will be
prompted for a password for every copy action.


File: tramp.info,  Node: Inline methods,  Next: External methods,  Prev: Connection types,  Up: Configuration

4.2 Inline methods
==================

Inline methods use the same login connection to transfer file contents.
Inline methods are quick and easy for small files.  They depend on the
availability of suitable encoding and decoding programs on the remote
host.  For local source and destination, TRAMP may use built-in
equivalents of such programs in Emacs.

   Inline methods can work in situations where an external transfer
program is unavailable.  Inline methods also work when transferring
files between different _user identities_ on the same host.

   TRAMP checks the remote host for the availability and usability of
one of the commands defined in ‘tramp-remote-coding-commands’.  TRAMP
uses the first reliable command it finds.  TRAMP’s search path can be
customized, see *note Remote programs::.

   In case none of the commands are available, TRAMP first transfers a
small Perl program to the remote host, and then tries to use that
program for encoding and decoding.

   To increase transfer speeds for large text files, TRAMP can use
compression before encoding.  The user option
‘tramp-inline-compress-start-size’ specifies the file size above which
to use this optimization.  This feature depends on the availability and
usability of one of the commands defined in
‘tramp-inline-compress-commands’.

‘rsh’

     ‘rsh’ is an option for connecting to hosts within local networks
     since ‘rsh’ is not as secure as other methods.  There should be no
     reason to use it, as ‘ssh’ is a both a complete replacement and
     ubiquitous.

‘ssh’

     ‘ssh’ is a more secure option than others to connect to a remote
     host.

     ‘ssh’ can also take extra parameters as port numbers.  For example,
     a host on port 42 is specified as ‘host#42’ (the real host name, a
     hash sign, then a port number).  It is the same as passing ‘-p 42’
     to the ‘ssh’ command.

‘telnet’

     Connecting to a remote host with ‘telnet’ is as insecure as the
     ‘rsh’ method.

‘su’

     Instead of connecting to a remote host, ‘su’ program allows editing
     as another user.  The host can be either ‘localhost’ or the host
     returned by the function ‘(system-name)’.  See *note Multi-hops::
     for an exception to this behavior.

‘sudo’

     Similar to ‘su’ method, ‘sudo’ uses ‘sudo’.  ‘sudo’ must have
     sufficient rights to start a shell.

     For security reasons, a ‘sudo’ connection is disabled after a
     predefined timeout (5 minutes by default).  This can be changed,
     see *note Predefined connection information::.

‘doas’

     This method is used on OpenBSD like the ‘sudo’ command.  Like the
     ‘sudo’ method, a ‘doas’ connection is disabled after a predefined
     timeout.

‘sg’

     The ‘sg’ program allows editing as different group.  The host can
     be either ‘localhost’ or the host returned by the function
     ‘(system-name)’.  The user name must be specified, but it denotes a
     group name.  See *note Multi-hops:: for an exception to this
     behavior.

‘sshx’

     Works like ‘ssh’ but without the extra authentication prompts.
     ‘sshx’ uses ‘ssh -t -t -l USER -o RemoteCommand='/bin/sh -i' HOST’
     to open a connection with a “standard” login shell.  It supports
     changing the remote login shell ‘/bin/sh’.

     *Note* that ‘sshx’ does not bypass authentication questions.  For
     example, if the host key of the remote host is not known, ‘sshx’
     will still ask “Are you sure you want to continue connecting?”.
     TRAMP cannot handle such questions.  Connections will have to be
     setup where logins can proceed without such questions.

     ‘sshx’ is useful for MS Windows users when ‘ssh’ triggers an error
     about allocating a pseudo tty.  This happens due to missing shell
     prompts that confuses TRAMP.

     ‘sshx’ supports the ‘-p’ argument.

‘krlogin’

     This method is also similar to ‘ssh’.  It uses the ‘krlogin -x’
     command only for remote host login.

‘ksu’

     This is another method from the Kerberos suite.  It behaves like
     ‘su’.

‘plink’

     ‘plink’ method is for MS Windows users with the PuTTY
     implementation of SSH.  It uses ‘plink -ssh’ to log in to the
     remote host.  It supports changing the remote login shell
     ‘/bin/sh’.

     Check the ‘Share SSH connections if possible’ control for that
     session.

     ‘plink’ method supports the ‘-P’ argument.

‘plinkx’

     Another method using PuTTY on MS Windows with session names instead
     of host names.  ‘plinkx’ calls ‘plink -load SESSION -t’.  User
     names and port numbers must be defined in the session.  It supports
     changing the remote login shell ‘/bin/sh’.

     Check the ‘Share SSH connections if possible’ control for that
     session.

4.3 External methods
====================

External methods operate over multiple channels, using the remote shell
connection for some actions while delegating file transfers to an
external transfer program.

   External methods save on the overhead of encoding and decoding of
inline methods.

   Since external methods have the overhead of opening a new channel,
files smaller than ‘tramp-copy-size-limit’ still use inline methods.

‘rcp’

     This method uses the ‘rsh’ and ‘rcp’ commands to connect to the
     remote host and transfer files.  This is the fastest access method
     available.

     The alternative method ‘remcp’ uses the ‘remsh’ and ‘rcp’ commands.

‘scp’

     Using a combination of ‘ssh’ to connect and ‘scp’ to transfer is
     the most secure.  While the performance is good, it is slower than
     the inline methods for smaller files.  Though there is no overhead
     of encoding and decoding of the inline methods, ‘scp’’s
     cryptographic handshake negates those speed gains.

     ‘ssh’-based methods support ‘-p’ feature for specifying port
     numbers.  For example, ‘host#42’ passes ‘-p 42’ in the argument
     list to ‘ssh’, and ‘-P 42’ in the argument list to ‘scp’.

‘rsync’

     ‘ssh’ command to connect in combination with ‘rsync’ command to
     transfer is similar to the ‘scp’ method.

     ‘rsync’ performs much better than ‘scp’ when transferring files
     that exist on both hosts.  However, this advantage is lost if the
     file exists only on one side of the connection.

     This method supports the ‘-p’ argument.

‘scpx’

     ‘scpx’ is useful to avoid login shell questions.  It is similar in
     performance to ‘scp’.  ‘scpx’ uses ‘ssh -t -t -l USER -o
     RemoteCommand='/bin/sh -i' HOST’ to open a connection.  It supports
     changing the remote login shell ‘/bin/sh’.

     ‘scpx’ is useful for MS Windows users when ‘ssh’ triggers an error
     about allocating a pseudo tty.  This happens due to missing shell
     prompts that confuses TRAMP.

     This method supports the ‘-p’ argument.

‘pscp’
‘psftp’

     These methods are similar to ‘scp’ or ‘sftp’, but they use the
     ‘plink’ command to connect to the remote host, and they use ‘pscp’
     or ‘psftp’ for transferring the files.  These programs are part of
     PuTTY, an SSH implementation for MS Windows.

     They support changing the remote login shell ‘/bin/sh’.

     Check the ‘Share SSH connections if possible’ control for that
     session.

     These methods support the ‘-P’ argument.

‘fcp’

     This method is similar to ‘scp’, but uses ‘fsh’ to connect and
     ‘fcp’ to transfer files.  ‘fsh/fcp’, a front-end for ‘ssh’, reuse
     ‘ssh’ session by submitting several commands.  This avoids the
     startup overhead due to ‘scp’’s secure connection.  Inline methods
     have similar benefits.

     The command used for this connection is: ‘fsh HOST -l USER /bin/sh
     -i’

     ‘fsh’ has no inline method since the multiplexing it offers is not
     useful for TRAMP.  ‘fsh’ connects to remote host and TRAMP keeps
     that one connection open.

‘nc’

     Using ‘telnet’ to connect and ‘nc’ to transfer files is sometimes
     the only combination suitable for accessing routers or NAS hosts.
     These dumb devices have severely restricted local shells, such as
     the ‘busybox’ and do not host any other encode or decode programs.

‘sudoedit’

     The ‘sudoedit’ method allows to edit a file as a different user on
     the local host.  You could regard this as TRAMP’s implementation of
     the ‘sudoedit’.  Contrary to the ‘sudo’ method, all magic file name
     functions are implemented by single ‘sudo ...’ commands.  The
     purpose is to make editing such a file as secure as possible; there
     must be no session running in the Emacs background which could be
     attacked from inside Emacs.

     Consequently, external processes are not implemented.

     The host name of such remote file names must represent the local
     host.  Since the default value is already proper, it is recommended
     not to use any host name in the remote file name, like
     ‘/sudoedit::/path/to/file’ or ‘/sudoedit:user@:/path/to/file’.

     Like the ‘sudo’ method, a ‘sudoedit’ password expires after a
     predefined timeout.

‘ftp’

     When TRAMP uses ‘ftp’, it forwards requests to whatever ftp program
     is specified by Ange FTP.  This external program must be capable of
     servicing requests from TRAMP.

‘smb’

     This non-native TRAMP method connects via the Server Message Block
     (SMB) networking protocol to hosts running file servers that are
     typically based on Samba or MS Windows.

     Using ‘smbclient’ requires a few tweaks when working with TRAMP:

     The first directory in the localname must be a share name on the
     remote host.

     Since some SMB share names end in the ‘$’ character, TRAMP must use
     ‘$$’ when specifying those shares to avoid environment variable
     substitutions.

     When TRAMP is not specific about the share name or uses the generic
     remote directory ‘/’, ‘smbclient’ returns all available shares.

     Since SMB authentication is based on each SMB share, TRAMP prompts
     for a password even when accessing a different share on the same
     SMB host.  This prompting can be suppressed by *note Password
     handling::.

     To accommodate user name/domain name syntax required by MS Windows
     authorization, TRAMP provides for an extended syntax in
     ‘user%domain’ format (where ‘user’ is the user name, ‘%’ is the
     percent symbol, and ‘domain’ is the MS Windows domain name).  An
     example:

          /smb:daniel%BIZARRE@melancholia:/daniel$$/.emacs

     where user ‘daniel’ connects as a domain user to the SMB host
     ‘melancholia’ in the MS Windows domain ‘BIZARRE’ to edit ‘.emacs’
     located in the home directory (share ‘daniel$’).

     Alternatively, for local WINS users (as opposed to domain users),
     substitute the domain name with the name of the local host in
     UPPERCASE as shown here:

          /smb:daniel%MELANCHOLIA@melancholia:/daniel$$/.emacs

     where user ‘daniel’ connects as local user to the SMB host
     ‘melancholia’ in the local domain ‘MELANCHOLIA’ to edit ‘.emacs’
     located in the home directory (share ‘daniel$’).

     The domain name and user name are optional for ‘smbclient’
     authentication.  When user name is not specified, ‘smbclient’ uses
     the anonymous user (without prompting for password).  This behavior
     is unlike other TRAMP methods, where local user name is
     substituted.

     The ‘smb’ method is unavailable if Emacs is run under a local user
     authentication context in MS Windows.  However such users can still
     access remote files using UNC file names instead of TRAMP:

          //melancholia/daniel$$/.emacs

     UNC file name specification does not allow the specification of a
     different user name for authentication like the ‘smbclient’ can.

‘adb’

     This method uses Android Debug Bridge program for accessing Android
     devices.  The Android Debug Bridge must be installed locally for
     TRAMP to work.  Some GNU/Linux distributions provide Android Debug
     Bridge as an installation package.  Alternatively, the program is
     installed as part of the Android SDK.  TRAMP finds the ‘adb’
     program either via the ‘PATH’ environment variable or the absolute
     path set in the user option ‘tramp-adb-program’.

     TRAMP connects to Android devices with ‘adb’ only when the user
     option ‘tramp-adb-connect-if-not-connected’ is not ‘nil’.
     Otherwise, the connection must be established outside Emacs.

     TRAMP does not require a host name part of the remote file name
     when a single Android device is connected to ‘adb’.  TRAMP instead
     uses ‘/adb::’ as the default name.  ‘adb devices’, run in a shell
     outside Emacs, shows available host names.

     ‘adb’ method normally does not need user name to authenticate on
     the Android device because it runs under the ‘adbd’ process.  But
     when a user name is specified, however, TRAMP applies an ‘su’ in
     the syntax.  When authentication does not succeed, especially on
     un-rooted Android devices, TRAMP displays login errors.

     For Android devices connected through TCP/IP, a port number can be
     specified using ‘device#42’ host name syntax or TRAMP can use the
     default value as declared in ‘adb’ command.  Port numbers are not
     applicable to Android devices connected through USB.


File: tramp.info,  Node: GVFS-based methods,  Next: FUSE-based methods,  Prev: External methods,  Up: Configuration

4.4 GVFS-based external methods
===============================

GVFS is the virtual file system for the GNOME Desktop,
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GVFS>.  Remote files on GVFS are mounted
locally through FUSE and TRAMP uses this locally mounted directory
internally.

   Emacs uses the D-Bus mechanism to communicate with GVFS.  Emacs must
have the message bus system, D-Bus integration active, *note D-Bus:
(dbus)Top.

‘afp’

     This method is for connecting to remote hosts with the Apple Filing
     Protocol for accessing files on macOS volumes.  TRAMP access syntax
     requires a leading volume (share) name, for example:
     ‘/afp:user@host:/volume’.

‘dav’
‘davs’

     ‘dav’ method provides access to WebDAV files and directories based
     on standard protocols, such as HTTP.  ‘davs’ does the same but with
     SSL encryption.  Both methods support the port numbers.

     Paths being part of the WebDAV volume to be mounted by GVFS, as it
     is common for OwnCloud or NextCloud file names, are not supported
     by these methods.  See method ‘nextcloud’ for handling them.

‘gdrive’

     Via the ‘gdrive’ method it is possible to access your Google Drive
     online storage.  User and host name of the remote file name are
     your email address of the Google Drive credentials, like
     ‘/gdrive:john.doe@gmail.com:/’.  These credentials must be
     populated in your ‘Online Accounts’ application outside Emacs.

     Since Google Drive uses cryptic blob file names internally, TRAMP
     works with the ‘display-name’ of the files.  This could produce
     unexpected behavior in case two files in the same directory have
     the same ‘display-name’, such a situation must be avoided.

‘mtp’

     Media devices, like cell phones, tablets, cameras, can be accessed
     via the ‘mtp’ method.  Just the device name is needed in order to
     specify the host in the file name.  However, the device must
     already be connected via USB, before accessing it.  Possible device
     names are visible via host name completion, *note File name
     completion::.

     Depending on the device type, the access could be read-only.  Some
     devices are accessible under different names in parallel, offering
     different parts of their file system.

     TRAMP does not require a host name as part of the remote file name
     when a single media device is connected.  TRAMP instead uses
     ‘/mtp::’ as the default name.

‘nextcloud’

     As the name indicates, the method ‘nextcloud’ allows you to access
     OwnCloud or NextCloud hosted files and directories.  Like the
     ‘gdrive’ method, your credentials must be populated in your ‘Online
     Accounts’ application outside Emacs.  The method supports port
     numbers.

‘sftp’

     This method uses ‘sftp’ in order to securely access remote hosts.
     ‘sftp’ is a more secure option for connecting to hosts that for
     security reasons refuse ‘ssh’ connections.

     When there is a respective entry in your ‘ssh’ configuration, do
     _not_ set the ‘RemoteCommand’ option.

 -- User Option: tramp-gvfs-methods
     This user option is a list of external methods for GVFS.  By
     default, this list includes ‘afp’, ‘dav’, ‘davs’, ‘gdrive’, ‘mtp’,
     ‘nextcloud’ and ‘sftp’.  Other methods to include are ‘ftp’,
     ‘http’, ‘https’ and ‘smb’.  These methods are not intended to be
     used directly as GVFS-based method.  Instead, they are added here
     for the benefit of *note Archive file names::.

     If you want to use GVFS-based ‘ftp’ or ‘smb’ methods, you must add
     them to ‘tramp-gvfs-methods’, and you must disable the
     corresponding Tramp package by setting ‘tramp-ftp-method’ or
     ‘tramp-smb-method’ to ‘nil’, respectively:

          (add-to-list 'tramp-gvfs-methods "ftp")
          (customize-set-variable 'tramp-ftp-method nil)


File: tramp.info,  Node: FUSE-based methods,  Next: Default Method,  Prev: GVFS-based methods,  Up: Configuration

4.5 FUSE-based external methods
===============================

Besides GVFS, there are other virtual file systems using the FUSE
interface.  Remote files are mounted locally through FUSE and TRAMP uses
this locally mounted directory internally.  When possible, TRAMP maps
the remote file names to their respective local file name, and applies
the file name operation on them.  For some of the file name operations
this is not possible, TRAMP emulates those operations otherwise.

‘rclone’

     The program ‘rclone’ allows to access different system storages in
     the cloud, see <https://rclone.org/> for a list of supported
     systems.  If the ‘rclone’ program isn’t found in your ‘PATH’
     environment variable, you can tell TRAMP its absolute path via the
     user option ‘tramp-rclone-program’.

     A system storage must be configured via the ‘rclone config’
     command, outside Emacs.  If you have configured a storage in
     ‘rclone’ under a name ‘storage’ (for example), you could access it
     via the remote file name

          /rclone:storage:/path/to/file

     User names are part of the ‘rclone’ configuration, and not needed
     in the remote file name.  If a user name is contained in the remote
     file name, it is ignored.

     Internally, TRAMP mounts the remote system storage at location
     ‘/tmp/tramp.rclone.storage’, with ‘storage’ being the name of the
     configured system storage.

     The mount point and optional flags to the different ‘rclone’
     operations could be passed as connection properties, *Note Setup of
     rclone method::.

     Access via ‘rclone’ is slow.  If you have an alternative method for
     accessing the system storage, you should use it.  *note GVFS-based
     methods:: for example, methods ‘gdrive’ and ‘nextcloud’.

‘sshfs’

     On local hosts which have installed the ‘sshfs’ client for mounting
     a file system based on ‘sftp’, this method can be used, see
     <https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs/blob/master/README.rst/>.  If the
     ‘sshfs’ program isn’t found in your ‘PATH’ environment variable,
     you can tell TRAMP its absolute path via the user option
     ‘tramp-sshfs-program’.

     All remote files are available via the local mount point.  TRAMP
     aids in mounting the file system if it isn’t mounted yet.  The
     remote file name syntax is

          /sshfs:user@host#port:/path/to/file

     User name and port number are optional.  This method does not
     support password handling, the file system must either be mounted
     already, or the connection must be established passwordless via ssh
     keys.

     The mount point and mount arguments could be passed as connection
     properties, *Note Setup of sshfs method::.


File: tramp.info,  Node: Default Method,  Next: Default User,  Prev: FUSE-based methods,  Up: Configuration

4.6 Selecting a default method
==============================

In a remote file name, the use of a default method is indicated by the
pseudo method ‘-’, *note File name syntax::.

 -- User Option: tramp-default-method
     Default method is for transferring files.  The user option
     ‘tramp-default-method’ sets it.  TRAMP uses this user option to
     determine the default method for remote file names that do not have
     one specified.

          (customize-set-variable 'tramp-default-method "ssh")

 -- User Option: tramp-default-method-alist
     Default methods for transferring files can be customized for
     specific user and host combinations through the user option
     ‘tramp-default-method-alist’.

     For example, the following two lines specify to use the ‘ssh’
     method for all user names matching ‘john’ and the ‘rsync’ method
     for all host names matching ‘lily’.  The third line specifies to
     use the ‘su’ method for the user ‘root’ on the host ‘localhost’.

          (add-to-list 'tramp-default-method-alist '("" "john" "ssh"))
          (add-to-list 'tramp-default-method-alist '("lily" "" "rsync"))
          (add-to-list 'tramp-default-method-alist
                       '("\\`localhost\\'" "\\`root\\'" "su"))

External methods performance faster for large files.  *note Inline
methods::.  *note External methods::.

   Choosing the access method also depends on the security environment.
For example, ‘rsh’ and ‘telnet’ methods that use clear text password
transfers are inappropriate for over the Internet connections.  Secure
remote connections should use ‘ssh’ that provide encryption.

4.6.1 Which method to use?
--------------------------

TRAMP provides maximum number of choices for maximum flexibility.
Choosing which method depends on the hosts, clients, network speeds, and
the security context.

   Start by using an inline method.

   External methods might be more efficient for large files, but most
TRAMP users edit small files more often than large files.

   Enable compression, ‘tramp-inline-compress-start-size’, for a
performance boost for large files.

   Since ‘ssh’ has become the most common method of remote host access
and it has the most reasonable security protocols, use ‘ssh’ method.
Typical ‘ssh’ usage to edit the ‘/etc/motd’ file on the otherhost:

     C-x C-f /ssh:root@otherhost:/etc/motd <RET>

   If ‘ssh’ is unavailable for whatever reason, look for other obvious
options.  For MS Windows, try the ‘plink’ method.  For Kerberos, try
‘krlogin’.

   For editing local files as ‘su’ or ‘sudo’ methods, try the shortened
syntax of ‘root’:

     C-x C-f /su::/etc/motd <RET>

   For editing large files, ‘scp’ is faster than ‘ssh’.  ‘pscp’ is
faster than ‘plink’.  But this speed improvement is not always true.


File: tramp.info,  Node: Default User,  Next: Default Host,  Prev: Default Method,  Up: Configuration

4.7 Selecting a default user
============================

 -- User Option: tramp-default-user
     A TRAMP file name can omit the user name part since TRAMP
     substitutes the currently logged-in user name.  However this
     substitution can be overridden with ‘tramp-default-user’.  For
     example:

          (customize-set-variable 'tramp-default-user "root")

 -- User Option: tramp-default-user-alist
     Instead of a single default user, ‘tramp-default-user-alist’ allows
     multiple default user values based on access method or host name
     combinations.  The alist can hold multiple values.  For example, to
     use the ‘john’ as the default user for the domain ‘somewhere.else’
     only:

          (add-to-list 'tramp-default-user-alist
                       '("ssh" ".*\\.somewhere\\.else\\'" "john"))

     A Caution: TRAMP will override any default user specified in the
     configuration files outside Emacs, such as ‘~/.ssh/config’.  To
     stop TRAMP from applying the default value, set the corresponding
     alist entry to ‘nil’:

          (add-to-list 'tramp-default-user-alist
                       '("ssh" "\\`here\\.somewhere\\.else\\'" nil))

     The last entry in ‘tramp-default-user-alist’ should be reserved for
     catch-all or most often used login.

          (add-to-list 'tramp-default-user-alist
                       '(nil nil "jonas") t)


File: tramp.info,  Node: Default Host,  Next: Multi-hops,  Prev: Default User,  Up: Configuration

4.8 Selecting a default host
============================

 -- User Option: tramp-default-host
     When host name is omitted, TRAMP substitutes the value from the
     ‘tramp-default-host’ user option.  It is initially populated with
     the local host name where Emacs is running.  The default method,
     default user and default host can be overridden as follows:

          (custom-set-variables
           '(tramp-default-method "ssh")
           '(tramp-default-user "john")
           '(tramp-default-host "target"))

     With all defaults set, ‘/-::’ will connect TRAMP to John’s home
     directory on ‘target’ via ‘ssh’.

 -- User Option: tramp-default-host-alist
     Instead of a single default host, ‘tramp-default-host-alist’ allows
     multiple default host values based on access method or user name
     combinations.  The alist can hold multiple values.  While
     ‘tramp-default-host’ is sufficient in most cases, some methods,
     like ‘adb’, require defaults overwritten.


File: tramp.info,  Node: Multi-hops,  Next: Firewalls,  Prev: Default Host,  Up: Configuration

4.9 Connecting to a remote host using multiple hops
===================================================

Multi-hops are methods to reach hosts behind firewalls or to reach the
outside world from inside a bastion host.  With multi-hops, TRAMP can
negotiate these hops with the appropriate user/host authentication at
each hop.  All methods until now have been the single hop kind, where
the start and end points of the connection did not have intermediate
check points.

 -- User Option: tramp-default-proxies-alist
     ‘tramp-default-proxies-alist’ specifies proxy hosts to pass
     through.  This user option is list of triples consisting of ‘(HOST
     USER PROXY)’.

     The first match is the proxy host through which passes the file
     name and the target host matching USER@HOST.  HOST and USER are
     regular expressions or ‘nil’, interpreted as a regular expression
     which always matches.

     PROXY is a literal TRAMP file name whose local name part is
     ignored, and the method and user name parts are optional.

     The method must be an inline method (*note Inline methods::).  If
     PROXY is ‘nil’, no additional hop is required reaching USER@HOST.

     For example, to pass through the host ‘bastion.your.domain’ as user
     ‘bird’ to reach remote hosts outside the local domain:

          (add-to-list 'tramp-default-proxies-alist
                       '("\\." nil "/ssh:bird@bastion.your.domain:"))
          (add-to-list 'tramp-default-proxies-alist
                       '("\\.your\\.domain\\'" nil nil))

     *Note*: ‘add-to-list’ adds elements at the beginning of a list.
     Therefore, most relevant rules must come last in the list.

     Proxy hosts can be cascaded in the alist.  If there is another host
     called ‘jump.your.domain’, which is the only host allowed to
     connect to ‘bastion.your.domain’, then:

          (add-to-list 'tramp-default-proxies-alist
                       '("\\`bastion\\.your\\.domain\\'"
                         "\\`bird\\'"
                         "/ssh:jump.your.domain:"))

     PROXY can take patterns ‘%h’ or ‘%u’ for HOST or USER respectively.
     Ports or domains, if they are part of a hop file name, are not
     expanded by those patterns.

     To login as ‘root’ on remote hosts in the domain ‘your.domain’, but
     login as ‘root’ is disabled for non-local access, then use this
     alist entry:

          (add-to-list 'tramp-default-proxies-alist
                       '("\\.your\\.domain\\'" "\\`root\\'" "/ssh:%h:"))

     Opening ‘/sudo:randomhost.your.domain:’ first connects to
     ‘randomhost.your.domain’ via ‘ssh’ under your account name, and
     then performs ‘sudo -u root’ on that host.

     It is key for the ‘sudo’ method in the above example to be applied
     on the host after reaching it and not on the local host.  TRAMP
     checks therefore, that the host name for such hops matches the host
     name of the previous hop.

     HOST, USER and PROXY can also take Lisp forms.  These forms when
     evaluated must return either a string or ‘nil’.

     To generalize (from the previous example): For all hosts, except my
     local one, first connect via ‘ssh’, and then apply ‘sudo -u root’:

          (add-to-list 'tramp-default-proxies-alist
                       '(nil "\\`root\\'" "/ssh:%h:"))
          (add-to-list 'tramp-default-proxies-alist
                       '((regexp-quote (system-name)) nil nil))

   Passing through hops involves dealing with restricted shells, such as
‘rbash’.  If TRAMP is made aware, then it would use them for proxies
only.

 -- User Option: tramp-restricted-shell-hosts-alist
     An alist of regular expressions of hosts running restricted shells,
     such as ‘rbash’.  TRAMP will then use them only as proxies.

     To specify the bastion host from the example above as running a
     restricted shell:

          (add-to-list 'tramp-restricted-shell-hosts-alist
                       "\\`bastion\\.your\\.domain\\'")

4.10 Passing firewalls
======================

Sometimes, it is not possible to reach a remote host directly.  A
firewall might be in the way, which could be passed via a proxy server.

   Both ssh and PuTTY support such proxy settings, using an HTTP tunnel
via the ‘CONNECT’ command (conforming to RFC 2616, 2817 specifications).
Proxy servers using HTTP 1.1 or later protocol support this command.

4.10.1 Tunneling with ssh
-------------------------

With ‘ssh’, you could use the ‘ProxyCommand’ entry in ‘~/.ssh/config’:

     Host host.other.domain
          ProxyCommand nc -X connect -x proxy.your.domain:3128 %h %p

   ‘nc’ is BSD’s netcat program, which establishes HTTP tunnels.  Any
other program with such a feature could be used as well.

   In the example, opening ‘/ssh:host.your.domain:’ passes the HTTP
proxy server ‘proxy.your.domain’ on port 3128.

4.10.2 Tunneling with PuTTY
---------------------------

PuTTY does not need an external program, HTTP tunnel support is
built-in.  In the PuTTY config program, create a session for
‘host.your.domain’.  In the ‘Connection/Data’ entry, select the ‘HTTP’
option, and add ‘proxy.your.domain’ as ‘Proxy hostname’, and 3128 as
‘Port’.

   Opening ‘/plinkx:host.your.domain:’ passes the HTTP proxy server
‘proxy.your.domain’ on port 3128.

4.11 Using Non-Standard Methods
===============================

The ‘tramp-methods’ variable currently has an exhaustive list of
predefined methods.  Any part of this list can be modified with more
suitable settings.  Refer to the Lisp documentation of that variable,
accessible with ‘C-h v tramp-methods <RET>’.

   In the ELPA archives, there are several examples of such extensions.
They can be installed with Emacs’s Package Manager.  This includes

‘docker-tramp’
     Integration for Docker containers.  A container is accessed via
     ‘/docker:user@container:/path/to/file’, where ‘user’ is the
     (optional) user that you want to use, and ‘container’ is the id or
     name of the container.

‘kubernetes-tramp’
     Integration for Docker containers deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.
     It is derived from ‘docker-tramp’.  A container is accessed via
     ‘/kubectl:user@container:/path/to/file’, ‘user’ and ‘container’
     have the same meaning as in ‘docker-tramp’.

‘lxc-tramp’
     Integration for LXC containers.  A container is accessed via
     ‘/lxc:container:/path/to/file’, ‘container’ has the same meaning as
     in ‘docker-tramp’.  A ‘user’ specification is ignored.

‘lxd-tramp’
     Integration for LXD containers.  A container is accessed via
     ‘/lxd:user@container:/path/to/file’, ‘user’ and ‘container’ have
     the same meaning as in ‘docker-tramp’.

‘magit-tramp’
     Browsing Git repositories with ‘magit’.  A versioned file is
     accessed via ‘/git:rev@root-dir:/path/to/file’.  ‘rev’ is a Git
     revision, and ‘root-dir’ is a virtual host name for the root
     directory, specified in ‘magit-tramp-hosts-alist’.

‘tramp-hdfs’
     Access of a hadoop/hdfs file system.  A file is accessed via
     ‘/hdfs:user@node:/path/to/file’, where ‘user’ is the user that you
     want to use, and ‘node’ is the name of the hadoop server.

‘vagrant-tramp’
     Convenience method to access vagrant boxes.  It is often used in
     multi-hop file names like ‘/vagrant:box|sudo:box:/path/to/file’,
     where ‘box’ is the name of the vagrant box.

4.12 Selecting config files for user/host name completion
=========================================================

‘tramp-completion-function-alist’ uses predefined files for user and
host name completion (*note File name completion::).  For each method,
it keeps a set of configuration files and a function that can parse that
file.  Each entry in ‘tramp-completion-function-alist’ is of the form
(METHOD PAIR1 PAIR2 ...).

   Each PAIR is composed of (FUNCTION FILE).  FUNCTION is responsible
for extracting user names and host names from FILE for completion.
There are two functions which access this variable:

 -- Function: tramp-get-completion-function method
     This function returns the list of completion functions for METHOD.

     Example:
          (tramp-get-completion-function "rsh")

               ⇒ ((tramp-parse-rhosts "/etc/hosts.equiv")
                   (tramp-parse-rhosts "~/.rhosts"))

 -- Function: tramp-set-completion-function method function-list
     This function sets FUNCTION-LIST as list of completion functions
     for METHOD.

     Example:
          (tramp-set-completion-function "ssh"
           '((tramp-parse-sconfig "/etc/ssh_config")
             (tramp-parse-sconfig "~/.ssh/config")))

               ⇒ ((tramp-parse-sconfig "/etc/ssh_config")
                   (tramp-parse-sconfig "~/.ssh/config"))

   The following predefined functions parsing configuration files exist:

‘tramp-parse-rhosts’

     This function parses files which are syntactical equivalent to
     ‘~/.rhosts’.  It returns both host names and user names, if
     specified.

‘tramp-parse-shosts’

     This function parses files which are syntactical equivalent to
     ‘~/.ssh/known_hosts’.  Since there are no user names specified in
     such files, it can return host names only.

‘tramp-parse-sconfig’

     This function returns the host nicknames defined by ‘Host’ entries
     in ‘~/.ssh/config’ style files.

‘tramp-parse-shostkeys’

     SSH2 parsing of directories ‘/etc/ssh2/hostkeys/*’ and
     ‘~/ssh2/hostkeys/*’.  Hosts are coded in file names
     ‘hostkey_PORTNUMBER_HOST-NAME.pub’.  User names are always ‘nil’.

‘tramp-parse-sknownhosts’

     Another SSH2 style parsing of directories like
     ‘/etc/ssh2/knownhosts/*’ and ‘~/ssh2/knownhosts/*’.  This case,
     hosts names are coded in file names ‘HOST-NAME.ALGORITHM.pub’.
     User names are always ‘nil’.

‘tramp-parse-hosts’

     A function dedicated to ‘/etc/hosts’ for host names.

‘tramp-parse-passwd’

     A function which parses ‘/etc/passwd’ for user names.

‘tramp-parse-etc-group’

     A function which parses ‘/etc/group’ for group names.

‘tramp-parse-netrc’

     A function which parses ‘~/.netrc’ and ‘~/.authinfo’-style files.

   To keep a custom file with custom data in a custom structure, a
custom function has to be provided.  This function must meet the
following conventions:

 -- Function: my-tramp-parse file
     FILE must be either a file on the host, or ‘nil’.  The function
     must return a list of (USER HOST), which are taken as candidates
     for completion for user and host names.

     Example:
          (my-tramp-parse "~/.my-tramp-hosts")

               ⇒ ((nil "toto") ("daniel" "melancholia"))


File: tramp.info,  Node: Password handling,  Next: Connection caching,  Prev: Customizing Completion,  Up: Configuration

4.13 Reusing passwords for several connections
==============================================

To avoid repeated prompts for passwords, consider native caching
mechanisms, such as ‘ssh-agent’ for ‘ssh’-like methods, or ‘pageant’ for
‘plink’-like methods.

   TRAMP offers alternatives when native solutions cannot meet the need.

4.13.1 Using an authentication file
-----------------------------------

The package ‘auth-source.el’, originally developed for No Gnus, reads
passwords from different sources, *Note auth-source: (auth)Help for
users.  The default authentication file is ‘~/.authinfo.gpg’, but this
can be changed via the user option ‘auth-sources’.

A typical entry in the authentication file:

     machine melancholia port scp login daniel password geheim

   The port can take any TRAMP method (*note Inline methods::, *note
External methods::).  Omitting port values matches all TRAMP methods.
Domain and ports, as used in TRAMP file name syntax, must be appended to
the machine and login items:

     machine melancholia#4711 port davs login daniel%BIZARRE password geheim

   If no proper entry exists, the password is read interactively.  After
successful login (verification of the password), Emacs offers to save a
corresponding entry for further use by ‘auth-source’ backends which
support this.  This can be changed by setting the user option
‘auth-source-save-behavior’ to ‘nil’.

   Set ‘auth-source-debug’ to ‘t’ to debug messages.

   *Note* that ‘auth-source.el’ is not used for ‘ftp’ connections,
because TRAMP passes the work to Ange FTP.  If you want, for example,
use your ‘~/.authinfo.gpg’ authentication file, you must customize
‘ange-ftp-netrc-filename’:

     (customize-set-variable 'ange-ftp-netrc-filename "~/.authinfo.gpg")

   In case you do not want to use an authentication file for TRAMP
passwords, use connection-local variables (*note (emacs)Connection
Variables::) like this:

     (connection-local-set-profile-variables
      'remote-without-auth-sources '((auth-sources . nil)))

     (connection-local-set-profiles
      '(:application tramp) 'remote-without-auth-sources)

4.13.2 Caching passwords
------------------------

TRAMP can cache passwords as entered and reuse when needed for the same
user or host name independent of the access method.

   ‘password-cache-expiry’ sets the duration (in seconds) the passwords
are remembered.  Passwords are never saved permanently nor can they
extend beyond the lifetime of the current Emacs session.  Set
‘password-cache-expiry’ to ‘nil’ to disable expiration.

   Set ‘password-cache’ to ‘nil’ to disable password caching.


File: tramp.info,  Node: Connection caching,  Next: Predefined connection information,  Prev: Password handling,  Up: Configuration

4.14 Reusing connection related information
===========================================

For faster initial connection times, TRAMP stores previous connection
properties in a file specified by the user option
‘tramp-persistency-file-name’.

   The default file name for ‘tramp-persistency-file-name’ is
‘~/.emacs.d/tramp’.

   TRAMP reads this file during Emacs startup, and writes to it when
exiting Emacs.  Delete this file for TRAMP to recreate a new one on next
Emacs startup.

   Set ‘tramp-persistency-file-name’ to ‘nil’ to disable storing
connections persistently.

   When TRAMP detects a change in the operating system version in a
remote host (via the command ‘uname -sr’), it flushes all connection
related information for that host and creates a new entry.


File: tramp.info,  Node: Predefined connection information,  Next: Remote programs,  Prev: Connection caching,  Up: Configuration

4.15 Setting own connection related information
===============================================

For more precise customization, parameters specified by ‘tramp-methods’
can be overwritten manually.

   Set ‘tramp-connection-properties’ to manually override
‘tramp-methods’.  Properties in this list are in the form ‘(REGEXP
PROPERTY VALUE)’.  REGEXP matches remote file names.  Use ‘nil’ to match
all.  PROPERTY is the property’s name, and VALUE is the property’s
value.

   PROPERTY is any method specific parameter contained in
‘tramp-methods’.  The parameter key in ‘tramp-methods’ is a symbol name
‘tramp-<foo>’.  To overwrite that property, use the string "<foo>" for
PROPERTY.  For example, this changes the remote shell:

     (add-to-list 'tramp-connection-properties
                  (list (regexp-quote "/ssh:user@randomhost.your.domain:")
                        "remote-shell" "/bin/ksh"))

     (add-to-list 'tramp-connection-properties
                  (list (regexp-quote "/ssh:user@randomhost.your.domain:")
                        "remote-shell-login" '("-")))

   The parameters ‘tramp-remote-shell’ and ‘tramp-remote-shell-login’ in
‘tramp-methods’ now have new values for the remote host.

   PROPERTY could also be any property found in
‘tramp-persistency-file-name’.

4.15.1 Relevant connection properties to override
-------------------------------------------------

Not all connection properties need to be changed.  The most relevant
properties are listed here:

   • "login-program"

     The property "login-program" stores the program to be used to
     connect to the remote host.  Sometimes, the program might have
     another name on your host, or it might be located in another path.
     In this case, you can overwrite the default value, which is special
     for every connection method.  It is used in all connection methods
     of ‘tramp-sh.el’.

   • "login-args"

     "login-args" specifies a list of lists of arguments to pass to
     "login-program".  Read the docstring of ‘tramp-methods’ how to
     construct these lists.

   • "remote-shell"

     This property tells Tramp which remote shell to apply on the remote
     host.  It is used in all connection methods of ‘tramp-sh.el’.  The
     default value is "/bin/sh".

   • "remote-shell-login"

     A property to be used in conjunction with "remote-shell".  It
     specifies, which shell argument triggers a login shell.  Its
     default value is "-l", but some shells, like ‘ksh’, prefer "-".

   • "session-timeout"

     All ‘tramp-sh.el’ based methods accept the property
     "session-timeout".  This is the time (in seconds) after a
     connection is disabled for security reasons, and must be
     reestablished.  A value of ‘nil’ disables this feature.  Most of
     the methods do not set this property except the ‘sudo’ and ‘doas’
     methods, which use predefined values.

   • "tmpdir"

     The temporary directory on the remote host.  If not specified, the
     default value is "/data/local/tmp" for the ‘adb’ method, "/C$/Temp"
     for the ‘smb’ method, and "/tmp" otherwise.

   • "direct-async-process"

     When this property is non-‘nil’, an alternative, more performant
     implementation of ‘make-process’ and ‘start-file-process’ is
     applied.  The connection method must also be marked with a
     non-‘nil’ ‘tramp-direct-async’ parameter in ‘tramp-methods’.  *note
     Improving performance of asynchronous remote processes:: for a
     discussion of constraints.

   • "posix"

     Connections using the ‘smb’ method check, whether the remote host
     supports posix commands.  If the remote host runs Samba, it
     confirms this capability.  However, some very old Samba versions
     have errors in their implementation.  In order to suppress the
     posix commands for those hosts, the property "posix" should be set
     to ‘nil’.

     The default value of this property is ‘t’ (not specified in
     ‘tramp-methods’).  If the remote host runs native MS Windows, this
     property has no effect.

   • "mount-point"

     The directory file name an FUSE-based file system is mounted on.
     The default value of this property is
     "/tmp/tramp.method.user@host#port" (not specified in
     ‘tramp-methods’).

   • "mount-args"
     "copyto-args"
     "moveto-args"
     "about-args"

     These properties keep optional flags to the different ‘rclone’
     operations.  See their default values in ‘tramp-methods’ if you
     want to change their values.

4.16 How TRAMP finds and uses programs on the remote host
=========================================================

TRAMP requires access to and rights to several commands on remote hosts:
‘ls’, ‘test’, ‘find’ and ‘cat’.

   Besides there are other required programs for *note Inline methods::
and *note External methods:: of connection.

   To improve performance and accuracy of remote file access, TRAMP uses
‘perl’ (or ‘perl5’) and ‘grep’ when available.

 -- User Option: tramp-remote-path
     ‘tramp-remote-path’ specifies which remote directory paths TRAMP
     can search for *note Remote programs::.

     TRAMP uses standard defaults, such as ‘/bin’ and ‘/usr/bin’, which
     are reasonable for most hosts.  To accommodate differences in hosts
     and paths, for example, ‘/bin:/usr/bin’ on Debian GNU/Linux or
     ‘/usr/xpg4/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/bin:/opt/developerstudio12.6/bin’
     on Solaris, TRAMP queries the remote host with ‘getconf PATH’ and
     updates the symbol ‘tramp-default-remote-path’.

     For instances where hosts keep obscure locations for paths for
     security reasons, manually add such paths to local ‘.emacs’ as
     shown below for TRAMP to use when connecting.

          (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path "/usr/local/perl/bin")

     Another way to find the remote path is to use the path assigned to
     the remote user by the remote host.  TRAMP does not normally retain
     this remote path after login.  However, ‘tramp-own-remote-path’
     preserves the path value, which can be used to update
     ‘tramp-remote-path’.

          (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path 'tramp-own-remote-path)

     *Note* that this works only if your remote ‘/bin/sh’ shell supports
     the login argument ‘-l’.

   Starting with Emacs 26, ‘tramp-remote-path’ can be set per host via
connection-local variables, *Note (emacs)Connection Variables::.  You
could define your own search directories like this:

     (connection-local-set-profile-variables 'remote-path-with-bin
        '((tramp-remote-path . ("~/bin" tramp-default-remote-path))))

     (connection-local-set-profile-variables 'remote-path-with-apply-pub-bin
        '((tramp-remote-path . ("/appli/pub/bin" tramp-default-remote-path))))

     (connection-local-set-profiles
        '(:application tramp :machine "randomhost") 'remote-path-with-bin)

     (connection-local-set-profiles
        '(:application tramp :user "anotheruser" :machine "anotherhost")
          'remote-path-with-apply-pub-bin)

   When remote search paths are changed, local TRAMP caches must be
recomputed.  To force TRAMP to recompute afresh, call ‘M-x
tramp-cleanup-this-connection <RET>’ or friends (*note Cleanup remote
connections::).


File: tramp.info,  Node: Remote shell setup,  Next: FUSE setup,  Prev: Remote programs,  Up: Configuration

4.17 Remote shell setup hints
=============================

4.17.1 Changing the default remote or local shell
-------------------------------------------------

By default, TRAMP uses the command ‘/bin/sh’ for starting a shell on the
remote host.  This can be changed by setting the connection property
"remote-shell"; see *note Predefined connection information::.  If you
want, for example, use ‘/usr/bin/zsh’ on a remote host, you might apply

     (add-to-list 'tramp-connection-properties
                  (list (regexp-quote "/sshx:user@host:")
                        "remote-shell" "/usr/bin/zsh"))

   This works only for connection methods which allow to override the
remote login shell, like ‘sshx’ or ‘plink’.  See *note Inline methods::
and *note External methods:: for connection methods which support this.

   This approach has also the advantage, that settings in
‘tramp-sh-extra-args’ will be applied.  For ‘zsh’, the trouble with the
shell prompt due to set zle options will be avoided.  For ‘bash’,
loading ‘~/.editrc’ or ‘~/.inputrc’ is suppressed.

   Similar problems can happen with the local shell Tramp uses to create
a process.  By default, it uses the command ‘/bin/sh’ for this, which
could also be a link to another shell.  In order to overwrite this, you
might apply

     (customize-set-variable 'tramp-encoding-shell "/usr/bin/zsh")

   This uses also the settings in ‘tramp-sh-extra-args’.

   *Note*: If you use an ‘ssh’-based method for connection, do _not_ set
the ‘RemoteCommand’ option in your ‘ssh’ configuration, for example to
‘screen’.  On the other hand, some ‘ssh’-based methods, like ‘sshx’ or
‘scpx’, silently overwrite a ‘RemoteCommand’ option of the configuration
file.

4.17.2 Other remote shell setup hints
-------------------------------------

TRAMP checks for the availability of standard programs in the usual
locations.  Common tactics include successively trying ‘test -e’,
‘/usr/bin/test -e’, and ‘/bin/test -e’.  ‘ls -d’ is another approach.
But these approaches do not help with these new login patterns.

   When TRAMP encounters two-factor logins or additional challenge
questions, such as entering birth date or security code or passphrase,
TRAMP needs a few more configuration steps to accommodate them.

   The difference between a password prompt and a passphrase prompt is
that the password for completing the login while the passphrase is for
authorizing access to local authentication information, such as the ssh
key.

   There is no one configuration to accommodate all the variations in
login security, especially not the exotic ones.  However, TRAMP provides
a few tweaks to address the most common ones.

‘tramp-shell-prompt-pattern’

     ‘tramp-shell-prompt-pattern’ is for remote login shell prompt,
     which may not be the same as the local login shell prompt,
     ‘shell-prompt-pattern’.  Since most hosts use identical prompts,
     TRAMP sets a similar default value for both prompts.

‘tramp-password-prompt-regexp’
‘tramp-wrong-passwd-regexp’

     TRAMP uses ‘tramp-password-prompt-regexp’ to distinguish between
     prompts for passwords and prompts for passphrases.  By default,
     ‘tramp-password-prompt-regexp’ handles the detection in English
     language environments.  See a localization example below:

          (customize-set-variable
           'tramp-password-prompt-regexp
            (concat
             "^.*"
             (regexp-opt
              '("passphrase" "Passphrase"
                ;; English
                "password" "Password"
                ;; Deutsch
                "passwort" "Passwort"
                ;; Français
                "mot de passe" "Mot de passe")
              t)
             ".*:\0? *"))

     This user option is, by default, initialised from
     ‘password-word-equivalents’ when TRAMP is loaded, and it is usually
     more convenient to add new passphrases to that user option instead
     of altering this user option.

     Similar localization may be necessary for handling wrong password
     prompts, for which TRAMP uses ‘tramp-wrong-passwd-regexp’.

‘tramp-terminal-type’

     TRAMP uses the user option ‘tramp-terminal-type’ to set the remote
     environment variable ‘TERM’ for the shells it runs.  By default, it
     is "dumb", but this could be changed.  A dumb terminal is best
     suited to run the background sessions of TRAMP.  However, running
     interactive remote shells might require a different setting.  This
     could be achieved by tweaking the ‘TERM’ environment variable in
     ‘process-environment’.

          (let ((process-environment
                 (cons "TERM=xterm-256color" process-environment)))
            (shell))

Determining a TRAMP session

     Sometimes, it is needed to identify whether a shell runs under
     TRAMP control.  The setting of environment variable ‘TERM’ will
     help:

          if test "$TERM" = "dumb"; then
             ...
          fi

     Another possibility is to check the environment variable
     ‘INSIDE_EMACS’.  Like for all subprocesses of Emacs, this is set to
     the version of the parent Emacs process, *Note (emacs)Interactive
     Shell::.  TRAMP adds its own package version to this string, which
     could be used for further tests in an inferior shell.  The string
     of that environment variable looks always like

          echo $INSIDE_EMACS
          ⇒ 27.2,tramp:2.4.5

‘tset’ and other questions

     To suppress inappropriate prompts for terminal type, TRAMP sets the
     ‘TERM’ environment variable before the remote login process begins
     via the user option ‘tramp-terminal-type’ (see above).  This will
     silence common ‘tset’ related prompts.

     TRAMP’s strategy for handling such prompts (commonly triggered from
     login scripts on remote hosts) is to set the environment variables
     so that no prompts interrupt the shell initialization process.

     An alternative approach is to configure TRAMP with strings that can
     identify such questions using ‘tramp-actions-before-shell’.
     Example:

          (defconst my-tramp-prompt-regexp
            "Enter the birth date of your mother:\\s-*"
            "Regular expression matching my login prompt question.")

          (defun my-tramp-action (proc vec)
            "Enter \"19000101\" in order to give a correct answer."
            (save-window-excursion
              (with-current-buffer (tramp-get-connection-buffer vec)
                (tramp-message vec 6 "\n%s" (buffer-string))
                (tramp-send-string vec "19000101"))))

          (add-to-list 'tramp-actions-before-shell
                       '(my-tramp-prompt-regexp my-tramp-action))

     The regular expressions used in ‘tramp-actions-before-shell’ must
     match the end of the connection buffer.  Due to performance
     reasons, this search starts at the end of the buffer, and it is
     limited to 256 characters backwards.

Conflicting names for users and variables in ‘.profile’

     When a user name is the same as a variable name in a local file,
     such as ‘.profile’, then TRAMP may send incorrect values for
     environment variables.  To avoid incorrect values, change the local
     variable name to something different from the user name.  For
     example, if the user name is ‘FRUMPLE’, then change the variable
     name to ‘FRUMPLE_DIR’.

Non-Bourne commands in ‘.profile’

     When the remote host’s ‘.profile’ is also used for shells other
     than Bourne shell, then some incompatible syntaxes for commands in
     ‘.profile’ may trigger errors in Bourne shell on the host and may
     not complete client’s TRAMP connections.

     One example of a Bourne shell incompatible syntax in ‘.profile’:
     using ‘export FOO=bar’ instead of ‘FOO=bar; export FOO’.  After
     remote login, TRAMP will trigger an error during its execution of
     ‘/bin/sh’ on the remote host because Bourne shell does not
     recognize the export command as entered in ‘.profile’.

     Likewise, (‘~’) character in paths will cause errors because Bourne
     shell does not do (‘~’) character expansions.

     One approach to avoiding these incompatibilities is to make all
     commands in ‘~/.shrc’ and ‘~/.profile’ Bourne shell compatible so
     TRAMP can complete connections to that remote.  To accommodate
     using non-Bourne shells on that remote, use other shell-specific
     config files.  For example, bash can use ‘~/.bash_profile’ and
     ignore ‘.profile’.

Interactive shell prompt

     TRAMP redefines the remote shell prompt internally for robust
     parsing.  This redefinition affects the looks of a prompt in an
     interactive remote shell through commands, such as ‘M-x shell
     <RET>’.  Such prompts, however, can be reset to something more
     readable and recognizable using these environment variables.

     TRAMP sets the ‘INSIDE_EMACS’ environment variable in the startup
     script file ‘~/.emacs_SHELLNAME’.

     ‘SHELLNAME’ is ‘bash’ or equivalent shell names.  Change it by
     setting the environment variable ‘ESHELL’ in the ‘.emacs’ as
     follows:

          (setenv "ESHELL" "bash")

     Then re-set the prompt string in ‘~/.emacs_SHELLNAME’ as follows:

          # Reset the prompt for remote TRAMP shells.
          if [ "${INSIDE_EMACS/*tramp*/tramp}" == "tramp" ] ; then
             PS1="[\u@\h \w]$ "
          fi

     *Note (emacs)Interactive Shell::.

‘busybox’ / ‘nc’

     TRAMP’s ‘nc’ method uses the ‘nc’ command to install and execute a
     listener as follows (see ‘tramp-methods’):

          $ nc -l -p 42

     The above command-line syntax has changed with ‘busybox’ versions.
     If ‘nc’ refuses the ‘-p’ parameter, then overwrite as follows:

          (add-to-list 'tramp-connection-properties
                       `(,(regexp-quote "192.168.0.1")
                         "remote-copy-args" (("-l") ("%r"))))

     where ‘192.168.0.1’ is the remote host IP address (*note Predefined
     connection information::).

4.18 FUSE setup hints
=====================

The FUSE file systems are mounted per default at
‘/tmp/tramp.method.user@host#port’.  The user name and port number are
optional.  If the file system is already mounted, it will be used as it
is.  If the mount point does not exist yet, TRAMP creates this
directory.

   The mount point can be overwritten by the connection property
"mount-point", *note Predefined connection information::.  Example:

     (add-to-list 'tramp-connection-properties
                  `(,(regexp-quote "/sshfs:user@host:")
                    "mount-point"
                    ,(expand-file-name "sshfs.user@host" user-emacs-directory)))

4.18.1 ‘rclone’ setup
---------------------

The default arguments of the ‘rclone’ operations ‘mount’, ‘coopyto’,
‘moveto’ and ‘about’ are declared in the variable ‘tramp-methods’ as
method specific parameters.  Usually, they don’t need to be overwritten.

   If needed, these parameters can be overwritten as connection
properties "mount-args", "copyto-args", "moveto-args" and "about-args",
*Note Predefined connection information::.  All of them are list of
strings.

   Be careful changing "--dir-cache-time", this could delay visibility
of files.

4.18.2 ‘sshfs’ setup
--------------------

The method ‘sshfs’ declares the mount arguments in the variable
‘tramp-methods’, passed to the ‘sshfs’ command.  This is a list of list
of strings, and can be overwritten by the connection property
"mount-args", *Note Predefined connection information::.

   Additionally, it declares also the arguments for running remote
processes, using the ‘ssh’ command.  These don’t need to be changed.

4.19 Android shell setup hints
==============================

TRAMP uses the ‘adb’ method to access Android devices.  Android devices
provide a restricted shell access through an USB connection.  The local
host must have the ‘adb’ program installed.  Usually, it is sufficient
to open the file ‘/adb::/’.  Then you can navigate in the file system
via ‘dired’.

   Alternatively, applications such as ‘Termux’ or ‘SSHDroid’ that run
‘sshd’ process on the Android device can accept any ‘ssh’-based methods
provided these settings are adjusted:

   • ‘sh’ must be specified for remote shell since Android devices do
     not provide ‘/bin/sh’.  ‘sh’ will then invoke whatever shell is
     installed on the device with this setting:

          (add-to-list 'tramp-connection-properties
                       (list (regexp-quote "192.168.0.26") "remote-shell" "sh"))

     where ‘192.168.0.26’ is the Android device’s IP address.  (*note
     Predefined connection information::).

   • TRAMP requires preserving ‘PATH’ environment variable from user
     settings.  Android devices prefer ‘/system/xbin’ path over
     ‘/system/bin’.  Both of these are set as follows:

          (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path 'tramp-own-remote-path)
          (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path "/system/xbin")

   • When the Android device is not ‘rooted’, specify a writable
     directory for temporary files:

          (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-process-environment "TMPDIR=$HOME")

   • Open a remote connection with the command ‘C-x C-f
     /ssh:192.168.0.26#2222: <RET>’, where ‘sshd’ is listening on port
     ‘2222’.

     To add a corresponding entry to the ‘~/.ssh/config’ file
     (recommended), use this:

          Host android
               HostName 192.168.0.26
               User root
               Port 2222

     To use the host name ‘android’ instead of the IP address shown in
     the previous example, fix the connection properties as follows:

          (add-to-list 'tramp-connection-properties
                       (list (regexp-quote "android") "remote-shell" "sh"))

     Open a remote connection with a more concise command ‘C-x C-f
     /ssh:android: <RET>’.


File: tramp.info,  Node: Auto-save and Backup,  Next: Keeping files encrypted,  Prev: Android shell setup,  Up: Configuration

4.20 Auto-save and Backup configuration
=======================================

To avoid TRAMP from saving backup files owned by ‘root’ to locations
accessible to others, default backup settings in
‘backup-directory-alist’ have to be altered.

   Here’s a scenario where files could be inadvertently exposed.  Emacs
by default writes backup files to the same directory as the original
files unless changed to another location, such as ‘~/.emacs.d/backups/’.
Such a directory will also be used by default by TRAMP when using, say,
a restricted file ‘/su:root@localhost:/etc/secretfile’.  The backup file
of the secretfile is now owned by the user logged in from TRAMP and not
‘root’.

   When ‘backup-directory-alist’ is ‘nil’ (the default), such problems
do not occur.

   To “turn off” the backup feature for remote files and stop TRAMP from
saving to the backup directory, use this:

     (add-to-list 'backup-directory-alist
                  (cons tramp-file-name-regexp nil))

Disabling backups can be targeted to just the ‘su’ and ‘sudo’ methods:

     (setq backup-enable-predicate
           (lambda (name)
             (and (normal-backup-enable-predicate name)
                  (not
                   (let ((method (file-remote-p name 'method)))
                     (when (stringp method)
                       (member method '("su" "sudo"))))))))

   Another option is to create better backup file naming with user and
host names prefixed to the file name.  For example, transforming
‘/etc/secretfile’ to
‘~/.emacs.d/backups/!su:root@localhost:!etc!secretfile’, set the TRAMP
user option ‘tramp-backup-directory-alist’ from the existing user option
‘backup-directory-alist’.

   Then TRAMP backs up to a file name that is transformed with a prefix
consisting of the DIRECTORY name.  This file name prefixing happens only
when the DIRECTORY is an absolute local file name.

Example:

     (add-to-list 'backup-directory-alist
                  (cons "." "~/.emacs.d/backups/"))
     (customize-set-variable
      'tramp-backup-directory-alist backup-directory-alist)

The backup file name of ‘/su:root@localhost:/etc/secretfile’ would be
‘/su:root@localhost:~/.emacs.d/backups/!su:root@localhost:!etc!secretfile~’

   Just as for backup files, similar issues of file naming affect
auto-saving remote files.  Auto-saved files are saved in the directory
specified by the user option ‘auto-save-file-name-transforms’.  By
default this is set to the local temporary directory.  But in some
versions of Debian GNU/Linux, this points to the source directory where
the Emacs was compiled.  Reset such values to a valid directory.

   Set ‘auto-save-file-name-transforms’ to ‘nil’ to save auto-saved
files to the same directory as the original file.

   Alternatively, set the user option ‘tramp-auto-save-directory’ to
direct all auto saves to that location.

   Per default, TRAMP asks for confirmation if a ‘root’-owned backup or
auto-save remote file has to be written to your local temporary
directory.  If you want to suppress this confirmation question, set user
option ‘tramp-allow-unsafe-temporary-files’ to ‘t’.

4.21 Protect remote files by encryption
=======================================

*Note*: File encryption in TRAMP is experimental, don’t use it in
production systems!

   Sometimes, it is desirable to protect files located on remote
directories, like cloud storages.  In order to do this, you might
instruct TRAMP to encrypt all files copied to a given remote directory,
and to decrypt such files when accessing.  This includes both file
contents and file names.

   TRAMP does this transparently.  Although both files and file names
are encrypted on the remote side, they are accessible inside Emacs as
they wouldn’t be transformed as such.

   Internally, TRAMP uses the ‘encfs’ package.  Therefore, this feature
is available only if this package is installed on the local host.  TRAMP
does not keep and ‘encfs mountpoint’ permanently.  Instead, it encrypts
/ decrypts files and file names on the fly, using ‘encfsctl’.

 -- Command: tramp-crypt-add-directory name
     This command marks the existing remote directory NAME for
     encryption.  Files in that directory and all subdirectories will be
     encrypted before copying to, and decrypted after copying from that
     directory.  File and directory names will be also encrypted.

 -- User Option: tramp-crypt-encfs-option
     If a remote directory is marked for encryption, it is initialized
     via ‘encfs’ the very first time a file in this directory is
     accessed.  This user option controls, which default ‘encfs’
     configuration option will be selected, it can be "--standard" or
     "--paranoia".  See the ‘encfs(1)’ man page for details.

     However, TRAMP must adapt these configuration sets.  The
     ‘chainedNameIV’ configuration option must be disabled; otherwise
     TRAMP couldn’t handle file name encryption transparently.

   A password protected ‘encfs’ configuration file is created the very
first time you access an encrypted remote directory.  It is kept in your
‘user-emacs-directory’ with the url-encoded directory name as part of
the basename, and ‘encfs6.xml’ as suffix.  If you, for example, mark the
remote directory ‘/nextcloud:user@host:/path/to/dir’ for encryption, the
configuration file is saved as
‘tramp-%2Fnextcloud%3Auser%40host%3A%2Fpath%2Fto%2Fdir%2F.encfs6.xml’ in
‘user-emacs-directory’.  Do not loose this file and the corresponding
password; otherwise there is no way to decrypt your encrypted files.

 -- User Option: tramp-crypt-save-encfs-config-remote
     If this user option is non-‘nil’ (the default), the ‘encfs’
     configuration file ‘.encfs6.xml’ is also kept in the encrypted
     remote directory.  It depends on you, whether you regard the
     password protection of this file as sufficient.  The advantage
     would be, that such a remote directory could be accessed by
     different Emacs sessions, different users, without presharing the
     configuration file between the users.

   The command ‘encfsctl’, the workhorse for encryption / decryption,
needs the configuration file password every call.  Therefore, it is
recommend to cache this password in Emacs.  This can be done using
‘auth-sources’, *note Using an authentication file::.  An entry needs
the url-encoded directory name as machine, your local user name as user,
and the password.  The port is optional, if given it must be the string
"crypt".  The example above would require the following entry in the
authentication file ("yourname" is the result of ‘(user-login-name)’):

     machine %2Fnextcloud%3Auser%40host%3A%2Fpath%2Fto%2Fdir%2F \
             login yourname port crypt password geheim

   If you use a remote file name with a quoted localname part, this
localname and the corresponding file will not be encrypted / decrypted.
If you have an encrypted remote directory
‘/nextcloud:user@host:/path/to/dir’, the command

     C-x d /nextcloud:user@host:/path/to/dir

will show the directory listing with the plain file names, and the
command

     C-x d /nextcloud:user@host:/:/path/to/dir

will show the directory listing with the encrypted file names, and
visiting a file will show its encrypted contents.  However, it is highly
discouraged to mix encrypted and not encrypted files in the same
directory.

 -- Command: tramp-crypt-remove-directory name
     This command should be used to indicate that files in ‘name’ should
     no longer be encrypted.  Existing encrypted files and
     subdirectories will remain encrypted.

4.22 Issues with Cygwin ssh
===========================

This section is incomplete.  Please share your solutions.

   Cygwin’s ‘ssh’ works only with a Cygwin version of Emacs.  To check
for compatibility: type ‘M-x eshell <RET>’, and start ‘ssh test.host
<RET>’.  Incompatibilities trigger this message:

     Pseudo-terminal will not be allocated because stdin is not a terminal.

   Some older versions of Cygwin’s ‘ssh’ work with the ‘sshx’ access
method.  Consult Cygwin’s FAQ at <https://cygwin.com/faq/> for details.

   On the Emacs Wiki (https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SshWithNTEmacs) it
is explained how to use the helper program ‘fakecygpty’ to fix this
problem.

   When using the ‘scpx’ access method, Emacs may call ‘scp’ with MS
Windows file naming, such as ‘c:/foo’.  But the version of ‘scp’ that is
installed with Cygwin does not know about MS Windows file naming, which
causes it to incorrectly look for a host named ‘c’.

   A workaround: write a wrapper script for ‘scp’ to convert Windows
file names to Cygwin file names.

   When using the ‘ssh-agent’ on MS Windows for password-less
interaction, ‘ssh’ methods depend on the environment variable
‘SSH_AUTH_SOCK’.  But this variable is not set when Emacs is started
from a Desktop shortcut and authentication fails.

   One workaround is to use an MS Windows based SSH Agent, such as
Pageant.  It is part of the Putty Suite of tools.

   The fallback is to start Emacs from a shell.

5 Using TRAMP
*************

TRAMP operates transparently, accessing remote files as if they are
local.  However, TRAMP employs a formalized remote file naming syntax to
perform its functions transparently.  This syntax consists of many parts
specifying access methods, authentication, host names, and file names.
Ange FTP uses a similar syntax.

   Unlike opening local files in Emacs, which are instantaneous, opening
remote files in TRAMP is slower at first.  Sometimes there is a
noticeable delay before the prompts for passwords or authentication
appear in the minibuffer.  Hitting ‘<RET>’ or other keys during this gap
will be processed by Emacs.  This type-ahead facility is a feature of
Emacs that may cause missed prompts when using TRAMP.

File: tramp.info,  Node: File name syntax,  Next: Change file name syntax,  Up: Usage

5.1 TRAMP file name conventions
===============================

‘/method:host:/path/to/file’ opens file /PATH/TO/FILE on the remote host
HOST, using the method METHOD.

‘/ssh:melancholia:.emacs’
     For the file ‘.emacs’ located in the home directory, on the host
     ‘melancholia’, using method ‘ssh’.

‘/ssh:melancholia.danann.net:.emacs’
     For the file ‘.emacs’ specified using the fully qualified domain
     name of the host.

‘/ssh:melancholia:~/.emacs’
     For the file ‘.emacs’ specified using the ‘~’, which is expanded.

‘/ssh:melancholia:~daniel/.emacs’
     For the file ‘.emacs’ located in ‘daniel’’s home directory on the
     host, ‘melancholia’.  The ‘~<user>’ construct is expanded to the
     home directory of that user on the remote host.

‘/ssh:melancholia:/etc/squid.conf’
     For the file ‘/etc/squid.conf’ on the host ‘melancholia’.

   HOST can take IPv4 or IPv6 address, as in ‘/ssh:127.0.0.1:.emacs’ or
‘/ssh:[::1]:.emacs’.  For syntactical reasons, IPv6 addresses must be
embedded in square brackets ‘[’ and ‘]’.

   By default, TRAMP will use the current local user name as the remote
user name for log in to the remote host.  Specifying a different name
using the proper syntax will override this default behavior:

     /method:user@host:path/to/file

   ‘/ssh:daniel@melancholia:.emacs’ is for file ‘.emacs’ in ‘daniel’’s
home directory on the host, ‘melancholia’, accessing via method ‘ssh’.

   For specifying port numbers, affix ‘#<port>’ to the host name.  For
example: ‘/ssh:daniel@melancholia#42:.emacs’.

   All method, user name, host name, port number and local name parts
are optional, *Note Default Method::, *Note Default User::, *Note
Default Host::.  For syntactical reasons, the default method must be
indicated by the pseudo method ‘-’.

5.2 Alternative file name syntax
================================

The syntax described in *note File name syntax:: is the ‘default’
syntax, which is active after Emacs startup.  However, this can be
changed.

 -- Command: tramp-change-syntax syntax
     This command changes the syntax TRAMP uses for remote file names.
     Beside the ‘default’ value, SYNTAX can be

        • ‘simplified’

          The remote file name syntax is similar to the syntax used by
          Ange FTP.  A remote file name has the form
          ‘/user@host:path/to/file’.  The ‘user@’ part is optional, and
          the method is determined by *note Default Method::.

        • ‘separate’

          The remote file name syntax is similar to the syntax used by
          XEmacs.  A remote file name has the form
          ‘/[method/user@host]path/to/file’.  The ‘method’ and ‘user@’
          parts are optional.

 -- Variable: tramp-file-name-regexp
     This variable keeps a regexp which matches the selected remote file
     name syntax.  Its value changes after every call of
     ‘tramp-change-syntax’.  However, it is not recommended to use this
     variable in external packages, a call of ‘file-remote-p’ is much
     more appropriate.  *note (elisp)Magic File Names::.


File: tramp.info,  Node: File name completion,  Next: Ad-hoc multi-hops,  Prev: Change file name syntax,  Up: Usage

5.3 File name completion
========================

TRAMP can complete the following TRAMP file name components: method
names, user names, host names, and file names located on remote hosts.
User name and host name completion is activated only, if file name
completion has one of the styles ‘basic’, ‘emacs21’, or ‘emacs22’.
*Note (emacs)Completion Styles::.

   For example, type ‘C-x C-f / s <TAB>’, TRAMP completion choices show
up as

       sbin/          scp:           scpx:          sftp:          sg:
       smb:           srv/           ssh:           sshx:          su:
       sudo:          sys/

   ‘ssh:’ is a possible completion for the respective method, and
‘sbin/’ stands for the directory ‘/sbin’ on your local host.

   Type ‘s h :’ for the minibuffer completion to ‘/ssh:’.  Typing
‘<TAB>’ shows host names TRAMP extracts from ‘~/.ssh/config’ file, for
example.

       ssh:127.0.0.1:                       ssh:192.168.0.1:
       ssh:[::1]:                           ssh:localhost:
       ssh:melancholia.danann.net:          ssh:melancholia:

   Choose a host from the above list and then continue to complete file
names on that host.

   When the configuration (*note Customizing Completion::) includes user
names, then the completion lists will account for the user names as
well.

   Results from ‘auth-sources’ search (*note Using an authentication
file::) are added to the completion candidates.  This search could be
annoying, for example due to a passphrase request of the
‘~/.authinfo.gpg’ authentication file.  The user option
‘tramp-completion-use-auth-sources’ controls, whether such a search is
performed during completion.

   Remote hosts previously visited or hosts whose connections are kept
persistently (*note Connection caching::) will be included in the
completion lists.

   After remote host name completion comes completion of file names on
the remote host.  It works the same as with local host file completion
except that killing with double-slash ‘//’ kills only the file name part
of the TRAMP file name syntax.  A triple-slash stands for the default
behavior.  *Note (emacs)Minibuffer File::.

Example:

     C-x C-f /ssh:melancholia:/usr/local/bin//etc <TAB>
          ⊣ /ssh:melancholia:/etc

     C-x C-f /ssh:melancholia://etc <TAB>
          ⊣ /ssh:melancholia:/etc

     C-x C-f /ssh:melancholia:/usr/local/bin///etc <TAB>
          ⊣ /etc

5.4 Declaring multiple hops in the file name
============================================

TRAMP file name syntax can accommodate ad-hoc specification of multiple
proxies without using ‘tramp-default-proxies-alist’ configuration setup
(*note Multi-hops::).

   Each proxy is specified using the same syntax as the remote host
specification minus the file name part.  Each hop is separated by a ‘|’.
Chain the proxies from the starting host to the destination remote host
name and file name.  For example, hopping over a single proxy
‘bird@bastion’ to a remote file on ‘you@remotehost’:

     C-x C-f /ssh:bird@bastion|ssh:you@remotehost:/path <RET>

   Each involved method must be an inline method (*note Inline
methods::).

   TRAMP adds the ad-hoc definitions on the fly to
‘tramp-default-proxies-alist’ and is available for re-use during that
Emacs session.  Subsequent TRAMP connections to the same remote host can
then use the shortcut form: ‘/ssh:you@remotehost:/path’.  Ad-hoc
definitions are removed from ‘tramp-default-proxies-alist’ via the
command ‘M-x tramp-cleanup-all-connections <RET>’ (*note Cleanup remote
connections::).

 -- User Option: tramp-save-ad-hoc-proxies
     For ad-hoc definitions to be saved automatically in
     ‘tramp-default-proxies-alist’ for future Emacs sessions, set
     ‘tramp-save-ad-hoc-proxies’ to non-‘nil’.

          (customize-set-variable 'tramp-save-ad-hoc-proxies t)

   Ad-hoc proxies can take patterns ‘%h’ or ‘%u’ like in
‘tramp-default-proxies-alist’.  The following file name expands to user
‘root’ on host ‘remotehost’, starting with an ‘ssh’ session on host
‘remotehost’: ‘/ssh:%h|su:remotehost:’.

   On the other hand, if a trailing hop does not specify a host name,
the host name of the previous hop is reused.  Therefore, the following
file name is equivalent to the previous example: ‘/ssh:remotehost|su::’.

5.5 Integration with other Emacs packages
=========================================

TRAMP supports starting new running processes on the remote host for
discovering remote file names.  Emacs packages on the remote host need
no specific modifications for TRAMP’s use.

   This type of integration does not work with the ‘ftp’ method, and
does not support the pty association as specified in
‘start-file-process’.

   ‘process-file’ and ‘start-file-process’ work on the remote host when
the variable ‘default-directory’ is remote:

     (let ((default-directory "/ssh:remote.host:"))
       (start-file-process "grep" (get-buffer-create "*grep*")
                           "/bin/sh" "-c" "grep -e tramp *"))

   For a local process, ‘process-file’ returns either the exit code of
the process, or a string describing a signal, when the process has been
interrupted.  Since it cannot be determined reliably whether a remote
process has been interrupted, ‘process-file’ will always returns the
exit code for it.  When the user option
‘process-file-return-signal-string’ is non-‘nil’, ‘process-file’ treats
all exit codes greater than 128 as an indication that the process has
been interrupted, and returns a corresponding string.

   This remote process handling does not apply to GVFS (see *note
GVFS-based methods::) because the remote file system is mounted on the
local host and TRAMP accesses it by changing the ‘default-directory’.

   TRAMP starts a remote process when a command is executed in a remote
file or directory buffer.  As of now, these packages have been
integrated to work with TRAMP: ‘shell.el’, ‘eshell.el’, ‘compile.el’
(commands like ‘compile’ and ‘grep’) and ‘gud.el’ (‘gdb’ or ‘perldb’).

   TRAMP always modifies the ‘INSIDE_EMACS’ environment variable for
remote processes.  By default, this environment variable shows the Emacs
version.  TRAMP adds its own version string, so it looks like
‘27.2,tramp:2.4.5.1’.  However, other packages might also add their name
to this environment variable, like ‘27.2,comint,tramp:2.4.5.1’.

   For TRAMP to find the command on the remote, it must be accessible
through the default search path as setup by TRAMP upon first connection.
Alternatively, use an absolute path or extend ‘tramp-remote-path’ (see
*note Remote programs::):

     (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path "~/bin")
     (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path "/appli/pub/bin")

   Customize user option ‘tramp-remote-process-environment’ to suit the
remote program’s environment for the remote host.
‘tramp-remote-process-environment’ is a list of strings structured
similar to ‘process-environment’, where each element is a string of the
form ‘ENVVARNAME=VALUE’.

   To avoid any conflicts with local host environment variables set
through local configuration files, such as ‘~/.profile’, use
‘ENVVARNAME=’ to unset them for the remote environment.

Use ‘add-to-list’ to add entries:

     (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-process-environment "JAVA_HOME=/opt/java")

   Modifying or deleting already existing values in the
‘tramp-remote-process-environment’ list may not be feasible on
restricted remote hosts.  For example, some system administrators
disallow changing ‘HISTORY’ environment variable.  To accommodate such
restrictions when using TRAMP, fix the
‘tramp-remote-process-environment’ by the following code in the local
‘.emacs’ file:

     (let ((process-environment tramp-remote-process-environment))
       (setenv "HISTORY" nil)
       (setq tramp-remote-process-environment process-environment))

   Setting the ‘ENV’ environment variable instructs some shells to read
an initialization file.  By default, TRAMP disables this.  You can
override this behavior by evaluating

     (let ((process-environment tramp-remote-process-environment))
       (setenv "ENV" "$HOME/.profile")
       (setq tramp-remote-process-environment process-environment))

   In addition to ‘tramp-remote-process-environment’, you can set
environment variables for individual remote process calls by let-binding
‘process-environment’.  TRAMP applies any entries not present in the
global default value of ‘process-environment’ (overriding
‘tramp-remote-process-environment’ settings, if they conflict).  For
example:

     (let ((process-environment (cons "HGPLAIN=1" process-environment)))
       (process-file ...))

   Let-binding in this way works regardless of whether the process to be
called is local or remote, since TRAMP would add just the ‘HGPLAIN’
setting and local processes would take whole value of
‘process-environment’ along with the new value of ‘HGPLAIN’.

   For integrating other Emacs packages so TRAMP can execute remotely,
please file a bug report.  *Note Bug Reports::.

5.5.1 Running remote programs that create local X11 windows
-----------------------------------------------------------

To allow a remote program to create an X11 window on the local host, set
the ‘DISPLAY’ environment variable for the remote host as follows in the
local ‘.emacs’ file:

     (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-process-environment
                  (format "DISPLAY=%s" (getenv "DISPLAY")))

‘(getenv "DISPLAY")’ should return a recognizable name for the local
host that the remote host can redirect X11 window interactions.  If
querying for a recognizable name is not possible for whatever reason,
then replace ‘(getenv "DISPLAY")’ with a hard-coded, fixed name.  Note
that using ‘:0’ for X11 display name here will not work as expected.

   An alternate approach is specify ‘ForwardX11 yes’ or
‘ForwardX11Trusted yes’ in ‘~/.ssh/config’ on the local host.

5.5.2 Running ‘shell’ on a remote host
--------------------------------------

Set ‘explicit-shell-file-name’ to the appropriate shell name when using
TRAMP between two hosts with different operating systems, such as
‘windows-nt’ and ‘gnu/linux’.  This option ensures the correct name of
the remote shell program.

   When ‘explicit-shell-file-name’ is equal to ‘nil’, calling ‘shell’
interactively will prompt for a shell name.

   Starting with Emacs 26, you could use connection-local variables for
setting different values of ‘explicit-shell-file-name’ for different
remote hosts.  *Note (emacs)Connection Variables::.

     (connection-local-set-profile-variables
       'remote-bash
       '((explicit-shell-file-name . "/bin/bash")
         (explicit-bash-args . ("-i"))))

     (connection-local-set-profile-variables
       'remote-ksh
       '((explicit-shell-file-name . "/bin/ksh")
         (explicit-ksh-args . ("-i"))))

     (connection-local-set-profiles
       '(:application tramp :protocol "ssh" :machine "localhost")
       'remote-bash)

     (connection-local-set-profiles
       `(:application tramp :protocol "sudo"
         :user "root" :machine ,(system-name))
       'remote-ksh)

5.5.3 Running ‘shell-command’ on a remote host
----------------------------------------------

‘shell-command’ executes commands synchronously or asynchronously on
remote hosts and displays output in buffers on the local host.  Example:

     C-x C-f /sudo:: <RET>
     M-& tail -f /var/log/syslog.log <RET>

   ‘tail’ command outputs continuously to the local buffer whose name is
the value of the variable ‘shell-command-buffer-name-async’.

   ‘M-x auto-revert-tail-mode <RET>’ runs similarly showing continuous
output.

   ‘shell-command’ uses the user option ‘shell-file-name’ and the
variable ‘shell-command-switch’ in order to determine which shell to
run.  For remote hosts, their default values are ‘/bin/sh’ and ‘-c’,
respectively (except for the ‘adb’ method, which uses ‘/system/bin/sh’).
Like the variables in the previous section, these variables can be
changed via connection-local variables.

   If Emacs supports the user option ‘async-shell-command-width’ (since
Emacs 27), TRAMP cares about its value for asynchronous shell commands.
It specifies the number of display columns for command output.  For
synchronous shell commands, a similar effect can be achieved by adding
the environment variable ‘COLUMNS’ to
‘tramp-remote-process-environment’.

5.5.4 Running ‘eshell’ on a remote host
---------------------------------------

TRAMP is integrated into ‘eshell.el’, which enables interactive eshell
sessions on remote hosts at the command prompt.  You must add the module
‘eshell-tramp’ to ‘eshell-modules-list’.  Here’s a sample interaction
after opening ‘M-x eshell <RET>’ on a remote host:

     ~ $ cd /sudo::/etc <RET>
     /sudo:root@host:/etc $ hostname <RET>
     host
     /sudo:root@host:/etc $ id <RET>
     uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
     /sudo:root@host:/etc $ find-file shadow <RET>
     #<buffer shadow>
     /sudo:root@host:/etc $

   ‘eshell’ added custom ‘su’ and ‘sudo’ commands that set the default
directory correctly for the ‘*eshell*’ buffer.  TRAMP silently updates
‘tramp-default-proxies-alist’ with an entry for this directory (*note
Multi-hops::):

     ~ $ cd /ssh:user@remotehost:/etc <RET>
     /ssh:user@remotehost:/etc $ find-file shadow <RET>
     File is not readable: /ssh:user@remotehost:/etc/shadow
     /ssh:user@remotehost:/etc $ sudo find-file shadow <RET>
     #<buffer shadow>

     /ssh:user@remotehost:/etc $ su - <RET>
     /su:root@remotehost:/root $ id <RET>
     uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
     /su:root@remotehost:/root $

5.5.5 Running a debugger on a remote host
-----------------------------------------

‘gud.el’ provides a unified interface to symbolic debuggers (*note
(emacs)Debuggers::).  TRAMP can run debug on remote hosts by calling
‘gdb’ with a remote file name:

     M-x gdb <RET>
     Run gdb (like this): gdb -i=mi /ssh:host:~/myprog <RET>

   Since the remote ‘gdb’ and ‘gdb-inferior’ processes do not belong to
the same process group on the remote host, there will be a warning,
which can be ignored:

     &"warning: GDB: Failed to set controlling terminal: Operation not permitted\n"

As consequence, there will be restrictions in I/O of the process to be
debugged.

   Relative file names are based on the remote default directory.  When
‘myprog.pl’ exists in ‘/ssh:host:/home/user’, valid calls include:

     M-x perldb <RET>
     Run perldb (like this): perl -d myprog.pl <RET>

   Just the local part of a remote file name, such as ‘perl -d
/home/user/myprog.pl’, is not possible.

   Arguments of the program to be debugged must be literal, can take
relative or absolute paths, but not remote paths.

5.5.6 Running remote processes on MS Windows hosts
--------------------------------------------------

‘winexe’ runs processes on a remote MS Windows host, and TRAMP can use
it for ‘process-file’ and ‘start-file-process’.

   ‘tramp-smb-winexe-program’ specifies the local ‘winexe’ command.
Powershell V2.0 on the remote host is required to run processes
triggered from TRAMP.

   ‘explicit-shell-file-name’ and ‘explicit-*-args’ have to be set
properly so ‘M-x shell <RET>’ can open a proper remote shell on a MS
Windows host.  To open ‘cmd’, set it as follows:

     (setq explicit-shell-file-name "cmd"
           explicit-cmd-args '("/q"))

To open ‘powershell’ as a remote shell, use this:

     (setq explicit-shell-file-name "powershell"
           explicit-powershell-args '("-file" "-"))

5.5.7 Improving performance of asynchronous remote processes
------------------------------------------------------------

TRAMP’s implementation of ‘make-process’ and ‘start-file-process’
requires a serious overhead for initialization, every process
invocation.  This is needed for handling interactive dialogues when
connecting the remote host (like providing a password), and initial
environment setup.

   Sometimes, this is not needed.  Instead of starting a remote shell
and running the command afterwards, it is sufficient to run the command
directly.  TRAMP supports this by an alternative implementation of
‘make-process’ and ‘start-file-process’.  This is triggered by the
connection property "direct-async-process", *Note Predefined connection
information::, which must be set to a non-‘nil’ value.  Example:

     (add-to-list 'tramp-connection-properties
                  (list (regexp-quote "/ssh:user@host:")
                        "direct-async-process" t))

   Using direct asynchronous processes in TRAMP is not possible, if the
remote host is connected via multiple hops (*note Multi-hops::).  In
this case, TRAMP falls back to its classical implementation.

   Furthermore, this approach has the following limitations:

   • It works only for connection methods defined in ‘tramp-sh.el’ and
     ‘tramp-adb.el’.

   • It does not support interactive user authentication.  With
     ‘ssh’-based methods, this can be avoided by using a password agent
     like ‘ssh-agent’, using public key authentication, or using
     ‘ControlMaster’ options.

   • It cannot be applied for ‘ssh’-based methods, which use the
     ‘RemoteCommand’ option.

   • It cannot be killed via ‘interrupt-process’.

   • It does not report the remote terminal name via ‘process-tty-name’.

   • It does not set process property ‘remote-pid’.

   • It does not use ‘tramp-remote-path’.

   In order to gain even more performance, it is recommended to bind
‘tramp-verbose’ to 0 when running ‘make-process’ or
‘start-file-process’.  Furthermore, you might set
‘tramp-use-ssh-controlmaster-options’ to ‘nil’ in order to bypass
TRAMP’s handling of the ‘ControlMaster’ options, and use your own
settings in ‘~/.ssh/config’.

5.6 Cleanup remote connections
==============================

TRAMP provides several ways to flush remote connections.

 -- Command: tramp-cleanup-connection vec &optional keep-debug
          keep-password
     This command flushes all connection related objects.  VEC is the
     internal representation of a remote connection.  When called
     interactively, this command lists active remote connections in the
     minibuffer.  Each connection is of the format ‘/method:user@host:’.

     Flushing remote connections also cleans the password cache (*note
     Password handling::), file cache, connection cache (*note
     Connection caching::), and recentf cache (*note (emacs)File
     Conveniences::).  It also deletes session timers (*note Predefined
     connection information::) and connection buffers.

     If KEEP-DEBUG is non-‘nil’, the debug buffer is kept.  A non-‘nil’
     KEEP-PASSWORD preserves the password cache.

 -- Command: tramp-cleanup-this-connection
     Flushes the current buffer’s remote connection objects, the same as
     in ‘tramp-cleanup-connection’.

 -- Command: tramp-cleanup-all-connections
     Flushes all active remote connection objects, the same as in
     ‘tramp-cleanup-connection’.  This command removes also ad-hoc proxy
     definitions (*note Ad-hoc multi-hops::).

 -- Command: tramp-cleanup-all-buffers
     Just as for ‘tramp-cleanup-all-connections’, all remote connections
     and ad-hoc proxy definition are cleaned up in addition to killing
     all buffers related to remote connections.


File: tramp.info,  Node: Renaming remote files,  Next: Archive file names,  Prev: Cleanup remote connections,  Up: Usage

5.7 Renaming remote files
=========================

Sometimes, it is desirable to safe file contents of buffers visiting a
given remote host.  This could happen for example, if the local host
changes its network integration, and the remote host is not reachable
anymore.

 -- Command: tramp-rename-files source target
     Replace in all buffers the visiting file name from SOURCE to
     TARGET.  SOURCE is a remote directory name, which could contain
     also a localname part.  TARGET is the directory name SOURCE is
     replaced with.  Often, TARGET is a remote directory name on another
     host, but it can also be a local directory name.  If TARGET has no
     local part, the local part from SOURCE is used.

     If TARGET is ‘nil’, it is selected according to the first match in
     ‘tramp-default-rename-alist’.  If called interactively, this match
     is offered as initial value for selection.

     On all buffers, which have a ‘buffer-file-name’ matching SOURCE,
     this name is modified by replacing SOURCE with TARGET.  This is
     applied by calling ‘set-visited-file-name’.  The new
     ‘buffer-file-name’ is prompted for modification in the minibuffer.
     The buffers are marked modified, and must be saved explicitly.

     If user option ‘tramp-confirm-rename-file-names’ is ‘nil’, changing
     the file name happens without confirmation.  This requires a
     matching entry in ‘tramp-default-rename-alist’.

     Remote buffers related to the remote connection identified by
     SOURCE, which are not visiting files, or which are visiting files
     not matching SOURCE, are not modified.

     Interactively, TARGET is selected from ‘tramp-default-rename-alist’
     without confirmation if the prefix argument is non-‘nil’.

     The remote connection identified by SOURCE is flushed by
     ‘tramp-cleanup-connection’.

 -- Command: tramp-rename-these-files target
     Replace visiting file names to TARGET.  The current buffer must be
     related to a remote connection.  In all buffers, which are visiting
     a file with the same directory name, the buffer file name is
     changed.

     Interactively, TARGET is selected from ‘tramp-default-rename-alist’
     without confirmation if the prefix argument is non-‘nil’.

 -- User Option: tramp-default-rename-alist
     The default target for renaming remote buffer file names.  This is
     an alist of cons cells ‘(source . target)’.  The first matching
     item specifies the target to be applied for renaming buffer file
     names from source via ‘tramp-rename-files’.  ‘source’ is a regular
     expressions, which matches a remote file name.  ‘target’ must be a
     directory name, which could be remote (including remote directories
     Tramp infers by default, such as ‘/method:user@host:’).

     ‘target’ can contain the patterns ‘%m’, ‘%u’ or ‘%h’, which are
     replaced by the method name, user name or host name of ‘source’
     when calling ‘tramp-rename-files’.

     ‘source’ could also be a Lisp form, which will be evaluated.  The
     result must be a string or ‘nil’, which is interpreted as a regular
     expression which always matches.

     Example entries:

          ("/ssh:badhost:/path/to/dir/"
           . "/ssh:goodhost:/path/to/another/dir/")

     would trigger renaming of buffer file names on ‘badhost’ to
     ‘goodhost’, including changing the directory name.

          ("/ssh:.+\\.company\\.org:" . "/ssh:multi.hop|ssh:%h:")

     routes all connections to a host in ‘company.org’ via
     ‘/ssh:multi.hop:’, which might be useful when using Emacs outside
     the company network.

          (nil . "~/saved-files/%m:%u@%h/")

     saves all remote files locally, with a directory name including
     method name, user name and host name of the remote connection.

 -- User Option: tramp-confirm-rename-file-names
     Whether renaming a buffer file name by ‘tramp-rename-files’ or
     ‘tramp-rename-these-files’ must be confirmed.


File: tramp.info,  Node: Archive file names,  Prev: Renaming remote files,  Up: Usage

5.8 Archive file names
======================

TRAMP offers also transparent access to files inside file archives.
This is possible only on hosts which have installed GVFS (the GNOME
Virtual File System), *note GVFS-based methods::.  Internally, file
archives are mounted via the GVFS ‘archive’ method.

   A file archive is a regular file of kind ‘/path/to/dir/file.EXT’.
The extension ‘.EXT’ identifies the type of the file archive.  A file
inside a file archive, called archive file name, has the name
‘/path/to/dir/file.EXT/dir/file’.

   Most of the *note magic file name operations: (elisp)Magic File
Names, are implemented for archive file names, exceptions are all
operations which write into a file archive, and process related
operations.  Therefore, functions like

     (copy-file "/path/to/dir/file.tar/dir/file" "/somewhere/else")

work out of the box.  This is also true for file name completion, and
for libraries like ‘dired’ or ‘ediff’, which accept archive file names
as well.

   File archives are identified by the file name extension ‘.EXT’.
Since GVFS uses internally the library ‘libarchive(3)’, all suffixes,
which are accepted by this library, work also for archive file names.
Accepted suffixes are listed in the constant ‘tramp-archive-suffixes’.
They are

   • ‘.7z’ — 7-Zip archives

   • ‘.apk’ — Android package kits

   • ‘.ar’ — UNIX archiver formats

   • ‘.cab’, ‘.CAB’ — Microsoft Windows cabinets

   • ‘.cpio’ — CPIO archives

   • ‘.deb’ — Debian packages

   • ‘.depot’ — HP-UX SD depots

   • ‘.exe’ — Self extracting Microsoft Windows EXE files

   • ‘.iso’ — ISO 9660 images

   • ‘.jar’ — Java archives

   • ‘.lzh’, ‘.LZH’ — Microsoft Windows compressed LHA archives

   • ‘.msu’, ‘.MSU’ — Microsoft Windows Update packages

   • ‘.mtree’ — BSD mtree format

   • ‘.odb’, ‘.odf’, ‘.odg’, ‘.odp’, ‘.ods’, ‘.odt’ — OpenDocument
     formats

   • ‘.pax’ — Posix archives

   • ‘.rar’ — RAR archives

   • ‘.rpm’ — Red Hat packages

   • ‘.shar’ — Shell archives

   • ‘.tar’, ‘.tbz’, ‘.tgz’, ‘.tlz’, ‘.txz’, ‘.tzst’ — (Compressed) tape
     archives

   • ‘.warc’ — Web archives

   • ‘.xar’ — macOS XAR archives

   • ‘.xpi’ — XPInstall Mozilla addons

   • ‘.xps’ — Open XML Paper Specification (OpenXPS) documents

   • ‘.zip’, ‘.ZIP’ — ZIP archives

   File archives could also be compressed, identified by an additional
compression suffix.  Valid compression suffixes are listed in the
constant ‘tramp-archive-compression-suffixes’.  They are ‘.bz2’, ‘.gz’,
‘.lrz’, ‘.lz’, ‘.lz4’, ‘.lzma’, ‘.lzo’, ‘.uu’, ‘.xz’, ‘.Z’, and ‘.zst’.
A valid archive file name would be ‘/path/to/dir/file.tar.gz/dir/file’.
Even several suffixes in a row are possible, like
‘/path/to/dir/file.tar.gz.uu/dir/file’.

   An archive file name could be a remote file name, as in
‘/ftp:anonymous@ftp.gnu.org:/gnu/tramp/tramp-2.4.5.tar.gz/INSTALL’.
Since all file operations are mapped internally to GVFS operations,
remote file names supported by ‘tramp-gvfs’ perform better, because no
local copy of the file archive must be downloaded first.  For example,
‘/sftp:user@host:...’ performs better than the similar
‘/scp:user@host:...’.  See the constant ‘tramp-archive-all-gvfs-methods’
for a complete list of ‘tramp-gvfs’ supported method names.

   If ‘url-handler-mode’ is enabled, archives could be visited via URLs,
like ‘https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/tramp/tramp-2.4.5.tar.gz/INSTALL’.  This
allows complex file operations like

     (progn
       (url-handler-mode 1)
       (ediff-directories
        "https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/tramp/tramp-2.4.4.tar.gz/tramp-2.4.4"
        "https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/tramp/tramp-2.4.5.tar.gz/tramp-2.4.5" ""))

   It is even possible to access file archives in file archives, as

     (progn

6 Reporting Bugs and Problems
*****************************

TRAMP’s development team is actively engaged in solving bugs and
problems and looks to feature requests and suggestions.

   TRAMP’s mailing list is the place for more advice and information on
working with TRAMP, solving problems, discussing, and general
discussions about TRAMP.

   TRAMP’s mailing list is moderated but even non-subscribers can post
for moderator approval.  Sometimes this approval step may take as long
as 48 hours due to public holidays.

   <tramp-devel@gnu.org> is the mailing list.  Messages sent to this
address go to all the subscribers.  This is _not_ the address to send
subscription requests to.

   To subscribe to the mailing list, visit: the TRAMP Mail Subscription
Page (https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/tramp-devel/).

   Check if the bug or problem is already addressed in *Note Frequently
Asked Questions::.

   Run ‘M-x tramp-bug <RET>’ to generate a buffer with details of the
system along with the details of the TRAMP installation.  Please include
these details with the bug report.

   The bug report must describe in as excruciating detail as possible
the steps required to reproduce the problem.  These details must include
the setup of the remote host and any special or unique conditions that
exist.

   Include a minimal test case that reproduces the problem.  This will
help the development team find the best solution and avoid unrelated
detours.

   To exclude cache-related problems, flush all caches before running
the test, *note Cleanup remote connections::.  Alternatively, and often
better for analysis, reproduce the problem in a clean Emacs session
started with ‘emacs -Q’.  Then, TRAMP does not load the persistency file
(*note Connection caching::), and it does not use passwords from
‘auth-source.el’ (*note Password handling::).

   When including TRAMP’s messages in the bug report, increase the
verbosity level to 6 (*note Traces: Traces and Profiles.) in the
‘~/.emacs’ file before repeating steps to the bug.  Include the contents
of the ‘*tramp/foo*’ and ‘*debug tramp/foo*’ buffers with the bug
report.  Both buffers could contain non-ASCII characters which are
relevant for analysis, append the buffers as attachments to the bug
report.  This is also needed in order to avoid line breaks during mail
transfer.

   *Note* that a verbosity level greater than 6 is not necessary at this
stage.  Also note that a verbosity level of 6 or greater, the contents
of files and directories will be included in the debug buffer.
Passwords typed in TRAMP will never be included there.

7 Frequently Asked Questions
****************************

   • Where is the latest TRAMP?

     TRAMP is available at the GNU URL:

     <https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/tramp/>

     TRAMP’s GNU project page is located here:

     <https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/tramp/>

   • Which systems does it work on?

     The package works successfully on Emacs 25, Emacs 26, Emacs 27, and
     Emacs 28.

     While Unix and Unix-like systems are the primary remote targets,
     TRAMP has equal success connecting to other platforms, such as MS
     Windows 7/8/10.

   • How to speed up TRAMP?

     TRAMP does many things in the background, some of which depends on
     network speeds, response speeds of remote hosts, and authentication
     delays.  During these operations, TRAMP’s responsiveness slows
     down.  Some suggestions within the scope of TRAMP’s settings
     include:

     Use an external method, such as ‘scp’, which are faster than
     internal methods.

     Keep the file ‘tramp-persistency-file-name’, which is where TRAMP
     caches remote information about hosts and files.  Caching is
     enabled by default.  Don’t disable it.

     Set ‘remote-file-name-inhibit-cache’ to ‘nil’ if remote files are
     not independently updated outside TRAMP’s control.  That cache
     cleanup will be necessary if the remote directories or files are
     updated independent of TRAMP.

     Disable version control to avoid delays:

          (setq vc-ignore-dir-regexp
                (format "\\(%s\\)\\|\\(%s\\)"
                        vc-ignore-dir-regexp
                        tramp-file-name-regexp))

     If this is too radical, because you want to use version control
     remotely, trim ‘vc-handled-backends’ to just those you care about,
     for example:

          (setq vc-handled-backends '(SVN Git))

     Disable excessive traces.  Set ‘tramp-verbose’ to 3 or lower,
     default being 3.  Increase trace levels temporarily when hunting
     for bugs.

   • TRAMP does not connect to the remote host

     Three main reasons for why TRAMP does not connect to the remote
     host:

        − Unknown characters in the prompt

          TRAMP needs a clean recognizable prompt on the remote host for
          accurate parsing.  Shell prompts that contain escape sequences
          for coloring cause parsing problems.  *note Remote shell
          setup:: for customizing prompt detection using regular
          expressions.

          To check if the remote host’s prompt is being recognized, use
          this test: switch to TRAMP connection buffer ‘*tramp/foo*’,
          put the cursor at the top of the buffer, and then apply the
          following expression:

               M-: (re-search-forward (concat tramp-shell-prompt-pattern "$")) <RET>

          If the cursor has not moved to the prompt at the bottom of the
          buffer, then TRAMP has failed to recognize the prompt.

          When using zsh on remote hosts, disable zsh line editor
          because zsh uses left-hand side and right-hand side prompts in
          parallel.  Add the following line to ‘~/.zshrc’:

               [[ $TERM == "dumb" ]] && unsetopt zle && PS1='$ ' && return

          This uses the default value of ‘tramp-terminal-type’, "dumb",
          as value of the ‘TERM’ environment variable.  If you want to
          use another value for ‘TERM’, change ‘tramp-terminal-type’ and
          this line accordingly.

          Alternatively, you could set the remote login shell
          explicitly.  See *note Remote shell setup:: for discussion of
          this technique,

          When using fish shell on remote hosts, disable fancy
          formatting by adding the following to
          ‘~/.config/fish/config.fish’:

               function fish_prompt
                 if test $TERM = "dumb"
                    echo "\$ "
                 else
                    ...
                 end
               end

          When using WinSSHD on remote hosts, TRAMP does not recognize
          the strange prompt settings.

          A similar problem exist with the iTerm2 shell integration,
          which sends proprietary escape codes when starting a shell.
          This can be suppressed by changing the respective integration
          snippet in your ‘~/.profile’ like this:

               [ $TERM = "dumb" ] || \
               test -e "${HOME}/.iterm2_shell_integration.bash" && \
               source "${HOME}/.iterm2_shell_integration.bash"

          And finally, bash’s readline should not use key bindings like
          ‘C-j’ to commands.  Disable this in your ‘~/.inputrc’:

               $if term=dumb
               # Don't bind Control-J or it messes up TRAMP.
               $else
               "\C-j": next-history
               $endif

        − Echoed characters after login

          TRAMP suppresses echos from remote hosts with the ‘stty -echo’
          command.  But sometimes it is too late to suppress welcome
          messages from the remote host containing harmful control
          characters.  Using ‘sshx’ or ‘scpx’ methods can avoid this
          problem because they allocate a pseudo tty.  *Note Inline
          methods::.

        − TRAMP stops transferring strings longer than 500 characters

          Set ‘tramp-chunksize’ to 500 to get around this problem, which
          is related to faulty implementation of ‘process-send-string’
          on HP-UX, FreeBSD and Tru64 Unix systems.  Consult the
          documentation for ‘tramp-chunksize’ to see when this is
          necessary.

          Set ‘file-precious-flag’ to ‘t’ for files accessed by TRAMP so
          the file contents are checked using checksum by first saving
          to a temporary file.  *note (elisp)Saving Buffers::.

               (add-hook
                'find-file-hook
                (lambda ()
                  (when (file-remote-p default-directory)
                    (set (make-local-variable 'file-precious-flag) t))))

   • TRAMP fails in a chrooted environment

     When connecting to a local host, TRAMP uses some internal
     optimizations.  They fail when Emacs runs in a chrooted
     environment.  In order to disable those optimizations, set user
     option ‘tramp-local-host-regexp’ to ‘nil’.

   • TRAMP does not recognize if a ‘ssh’ session hangs

     ‘ssh’ sessions on the local host hang when the network is down.
     TRAMP cannot safely detect such hangs.  The network configuration
     for ‘ssh’ can be configured to kill such hangs with the following
     command in the ‘~/.ssh/config’:

          Host *
               ServerAliveInterval 5

   • TRAMP does not use default ‘ssh’ ‘ControlPath’

     TRAMP overwrites ‘ControlPath’ settings when initiating ‘ssh’
     sessions.  TRAMP does this to fend off a stall if a master session
     opened outside the Emacs session is no longer open.  That is why
     TRAMP prompts for the password again even if there is an ‘ssh’
     already open.

     Some ‘ssh’ versions support a ‘ControlPersist’ option, which allows
     you to set the ‘ControlPath’ provided the variable
     ‘tramp-ssh-controlmaster-options’ is customized as follows:

          (customize-set-variable
           'tramp-ssh-controlmaster-options
           (concat
             "-o ControlPath=/tmp/ssh-ControlPath-%%r@%%h:%%p "
             "-o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=yes"))

     Note how ‘%r’, ‘%h’ and ‘%p’ must be encoded as ‘%%r’, ‘%%h’ and
     ‘%%p’.

     If the ‘~/.ssh/config’ file is configured appropriately for the
     above behavior, then any changes to ‘ssh’ can be suppressed with
     this ‘nil’ setting:

          (customize-set-variable 'tramp-use-ssh-controlmaster-options nil)

     This should also be set to ‘nil’ if you use the ‘ProxyCommand’ or
     ‘ProxyJump’ options in your ‘ssh’ configuration.

     On MS Windows, ‘tramp-use-ssh-controlmaster-options’ is set to
     ‘nil’ by default, because the MS Windows and MSYS2 implementations
     of ‘OpenSSH’ do not support this option properly.

   • On multi-hop connections, TRAMP does not use ‘ssh’ ‘ControlMaster’

     In order to use the ‘ControlMaster’ option, TRAMP must check
     whether the ‘ssh’ client supports this option.  This is only
     possible on the local host, for the first hop.  TRAMP does not use
     this option on proxy hosts.

     If you want to use this option also for the other hops, you must
     configure ‘~/.ssh/config’ on the proxy host:

          Host *
               ControlMaster      auto
               ControlPath        tramp.%C
               ControlPersist     no

     Check the ‘ssh_config(5)’ man page whether these options are
     supported on your proxy host.

   • TRAMP does not connect to Samba or MS Windows hosts running SMB1
     connection protocol

     Recent versions of ‘smbclient’ do not support old connection
     protocols by default.  In order to connect to such a host, add a
     respective option:

          (add-to-list 'tramp-smb-options "client min protocol=NT1")

     *Note* that using a deprecated connection protocol raises security
     problems, you should do it only if absolutely necessary.

   • File name completion does not work with TRAMP

     ANSI escape sequences from the remote shell may cause errors in
     TRAMP’s parsing of remote buffers.

     To test if this is the case, open a remote shell and check if the
     output of ‘ls’ is in color.

     To disable ANSI escape sequences from the remote hosts, disable
     ‘--color=yes’ or ‘--color=auto’ in the remote host’s ‘.bashrc’ or
     ‘.profile’.  Turn this alias on and off to see if file name
     completion works.

   • File name completion does not work in directories with large number
     of files

     This may be related to globbing, which is the use of shell’s
     ability to expand wild card specifications, such as ‘*.c’.  For
     directories with large number of files, globbing might exceed the
     shell’s limit on length of command lines and hang.  TRAMP uses
     globbing.

     To test if globbing hangs, open a shell on the remote host and then
     run ‘ls -d * ..?* > /dev/null’.

     When testing, ensure the remote shell is the same shell (‘/bin/sh’,
     ‘ksh’ or ‘bash’), that TRAMP uses when connecting to that host.

   • How to get notified after TRAMP completes file transfers?

     Make Emacs beep after reading from or writing to the remote host
     with the following code in ‘~/.emacs’.

          (defadvice tramp-handle-write-region
            (after tramp-write-beep-advice activate)
            "Make TRAMP beep after writing a file."
            (interactive)
            (beep))

          (defadvice tramp-handle-do-copy-or-rename-file
            (after tramp-copy-beep-advice activate)
            "Make TRAMP beep after copying a file."
            (interactive)
            (beep))

          (defadvice tramp-handle-insert-file-contents
            (after tramp-insert-beep-advice activate)
            "Make TRAMP beep after inserting a file."
            (interactive)
            (beep))

   • How to get a Visual Warning when working with ‘root’ privileges?
     Host indication in the mode line?

     Install ‘tramp-theme’ from GNU ELPA via Emacs’s Package Manager.
     Enable it via ‘M-x load-theme <RET> tramp <RET>’.  Further
     customization is explained in user option
     ‘tramp-theme-face-remapping-alist’.

   • Remote host does not understand default options for directory
     listing

     Emacs computes the ‘dired’ options based on the local host but if
     the remote host cannot understand the same ‘ls’ command, then set
     them with a hook as follows:

          (add-hook
           'dired-before-readin-hook
           (lambda ()
             (when (file-remote-p default-directory)
               (setq dired-actual-switches "-al"))))

   • Why is ‘~/.sh_history’ on the remote host growing?

     Due to the remote shell saving tilde expansions triggered by TRAMP,
     the history file is probably growing rapidly.  TRAMP can suppress
     this behavior with the user option ‘tramp-histfile-override’.  When
     set to ‘t’, environment variable ‘HISTFILE’ is unset, and
     environment variables ‘HISTFILESIZE’ and ‘HISTSIZE’ are set to 0.
     Don’t use this with ‘bash’ 5.0.0.  There is a bug in ‘bash’ which
     lets ‘bash’ die.

     Alternatively, ‘tramp-histfile-override’ could be a string.
     Environment variable ‘HISTFILE’ is set to this file name then.  Be
     careful when setting to ‘/dev/null’; this might result in undesired
     results when using ‘bash’ as remote shell.

     Another approach is to disable TRAMP’s handling of the ‘HISTFILE’
     at all by setting ‘tramp-histfile-override’ to ‘nil’.  In this
     case, saving history could be turned off by putting this shell code
     in ‘.bashrc’ or ‘.kshrc’:

          if [ -f $HOME/.sh_history ] ; then
             /bin/rm $HOME/.sh_history
          fi
          if [ "${HISTFILE-unset}" != "unset" ] ; then
             unset HISTFILE
          fi
          if [ "${HISTSIZE-unset}" != "unset" ] ; then
             unset HISTSIZE
          fi

     For ‘ssh’-based method, add the following line to your
     ‘~/.ssh/environment’:

          HISTFILE=/dev/null

   • Where are remote files trashed to?

     Emacs can trash file instead of deleting them, *note Trashing:
     (emacs)Misc File Ops.  Remote files are always trashed to the local
     trash, except remote encrypted files (*note Keeping files
     encrypted::), which are deleted anyway.

     If Emacs is configured to use the XDG conventions for the trash
     directory, remote files cannot be restored with the respective
     tools, because those conventions don’t specify remote paths.  Such
     files must be restored by moving them manually from
     ‘${XDG_DATA_HOME}/Trash/files/’, if needed.

   • How to shorten long file names when typing in TRAMP?

     Adapt several of these approaches to reduce typing.  If the full
     name is ‘/ssh:news@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc’, then:

       1. Use simplified syntax:

          If you always apply the default method (*note Default
          Method::), you could use the simplified TRAMP syntax (*note
          Change file name syntax::):

               (customize-set-variable 'tramp-default-method "ssh")
               (tramp-change-syntax 'simplified)

          The reduced typing: ‘C-x C-f
          /news@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc <RET>’.

       2. Use default values for method name and user name:

          You can define default methods and user names for hosts,
          (*note Default Method::, *note Default User::):

               (custom-set-variables
                '(tramp-default-method "ssh")
                '(tramp-default-user "news"))

          The reduced typing: ‘C-x C-f /-:news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc
          <RET>’.

          *Note* that there are some useful shortcuts already.
          Accessing your local host as ‘root’ user, is possible just by
          ‘C-x C-f /su:: <RET>’.

       3. Use configuration options of the access method:

          Programs used for access methods already offer powerful
          configurations (*note Customizing Completion::).  For ‘ssh’,
          configure the file ‘~/.ssh/config’:

               Host xy
                    HostName news.my.domain
                    User news

          The reduced typing: ‘C-x C-f /ssh:xy:/opt/news/etc <RET>’.

          Depending on the number of files in the directories, host
          names completion can further reduce key strokes: ‘C-x C-f
          /ssh:x <TAB>’.

       4. Use environment variables to expand long strings:

          For long file names, set up environment variables that are
          expanded in the minibuffer.  Environment variables are set
          either outside Emacs or inside Emacs with Lisp:

               (setenv "xy" "/ssh:news@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc/")

          The reduced typing: ‘C-x C-f $xy <RET>’.

          *Note* that file name cannot be edited here because the
          environment variables are not expanded during editing in the
          minibuffer.

       5. Define own keys:

          Redefine another key sequence in Emacs for ‘C-x C-f’:

               (global-set-key
                [(control x) (control y)]
                (lambda ()
                  (interactive)
                  (find-file
                   (read-file-name
                    "Find TRAMP file: "
                    "/ssh:news@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc/"))))

          Simply typing ‘C-x C-y’ would prepare minibuffer editing of
          file name.

          See the Emacs Wiki (https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TrampMode)
          for a more comprehensive example.

       6. Define own abbreviation (1):

          Abbreviation list expansion can be used to reduce typing long
          file names:

               (add-to-list 'directory-abbrev-alist
                            '("^/xy" . "/ssh:news@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc/"))

          The reduced typing: ‘C-x C-f /xy <RET>’.

          *Note* that file name cannot be edited here because the
          abbreviations are not expanded during editing in the
          minibuffer.  Furthermore, the abbreviation is not expanded
          during <TAB> completion.

       7. Define own abbreviation (2):

          The ‘abbrev-mode’ gives additional flexibility for editing in
          the minibuffer:

               (define-abbrev-table 'my-tramp-abbrev-table
                 '(("xy" "/ssh:news@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc/")))

               (add-hook
                'minibuffer-setup-hook
                (lambda ()
                  (abbrev-mode 1)
                  (setq local-abbrev-table my-tramp-abbrev-table)))

               (defadvice minibuffer-complete
                 (before my-minibuffer-complete activate)
                 (expand-abbrev))

               ;; If you use partial-completion-mode
               (defadvice PC-do-completion
                 (before my-PC-do-completion activate)
                 (expand-abbrev))

          The reduced typing: ‘C-x C-f xy <TAB>’.

          The minibuffer expands for further editing.

       8. Use bookmarks:

          Use bookmarks to save TRAMP file names.  *note
          (emacs)Bookmarks::.

          Upon visiting a location with TRAMP, save it as a bookmark
          with ‘<menu-bar> <edit> <bookmarks> <set>’.

          To revisit that bookmark: ‘<menu-bar> <edit> <bookmarks>
          <jump>’.

       9. Use recent files:

          ‘recentf’ remembers visited places.  *note (emacs)File
          Conveniences::.

          Keep remote file names in the recent list without have to
          check for their accessibility through remote access:

               (recentf-mode 1)

          Reaching recently opened files: ‘<menu-bar> <file> <Open
          Recent>’.

       10. Use filecache:

          Since ‘filecache’ remembers visited places, add the remote
          directory to the cache:

               (with-eval-after-load 'filecache
                 (file-cache-add-directory
                   "/ssh:news@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc/"))

          Then use directory completion in the minibuffer with ‘C-x C-f
          C-<TAB>’.

       11. Use bbdb:

          ‘bbdb’ has a built-in feature for Ange FTP files, which also
          works for TRAMP file names.  *note Storing FTP sites in the
          BBDB: (bbdb)bbdb-ftp.

          Load ‘bbdb’ in Emacs:

               (require 'bbdb)
               (bbdb-initialize)

          Create a BBDB entry with ‘M-x bbdb-create-ftp-site <RET>’.
          Then specify a method and user name where needed.  Examples:

               M-x bbdb-create-ftp-site <RET>
               Ftp Site: news.my.domain <RET>
               Ftp Directory: /opt/news/etc/ <RET>
               Ftp Username: ssh:news <RET>
               Company: <RET>
               Additional Comments: <RET>

          In BBDB buffer, access an entry by pressing the key ‘F’.

     Thanks to TRAMP users for contributing to these recipes.

   • Why saved multi-hop file names do not work in a new Emacs session?

     When saving ad-hoc multi-hop TRAMP file names (*note Ad-hoc
     multi-hops::) via bookmarks, recent files, filecache, bbdb, or
     another package, use the full ad-hoc file name including all hops,
     like ‘/ssh:bird@bastion|ssh:news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc’.

     Alternatively, when saving abbreviated multi-hop file names
     ‘/ssh:news@news.my.domain:/opt/news/etc’, the user option
     ‘tramp-save-ad-hoc-proxies’ must be set non-‘nil’ value.

   • How to connect to a remote Emacs session using TRAMP?

     Configure Emacs Client (*note (emacs)Emacs Server::).

     Then on the remote host, start the Emacs Server:

          (require 'server)
          (setq server-host (system-name)
                server-use-tcp t)
          (server-start)

     If ‘(system-name)’ of the remote host cannot be resolved on the
     local host, use IP address instead.

     Copy from the remote host the resulting file
     ‘~/.emacs.d/server/server’ to the local host, to the same location.

     Then start Emacs Client from the command line:

          emacsclient /ssh:user@host:/file/to/edit

     ‘user’ and ‘host’ refer to the local host.

     To make Emacs Client an editor for other programs, use a wrapper
     script ‘emacsclient.sh’:

          #!/bin/sh
          emacsclient /ssh:$(whoami)@$(hostname --fqdn):$1

     Then change the environment variable ‘EDITOR’ to point to the
     wrapper script:

          export EDITOR=/path/to/emacsclient.sh

   • How to determine whether a buffer is remote?

     The buffer-local variable ‘default-directory’ tells this.  If the
     form ‘(file-remote-p default-directory)’ returns non-‘nil’, the
     buffer is remote.  See the optional arguments of ‘file-remote-p’
     for determining details of the remote connection.

   • How to save files when a remote host isn’t reachable anymore?

     If the local machine Emacs is running on changes its network
     integration, remote hosts could become unreachable.  This happens
     for example, if the local machine is moved between your office and
     your home without restarting Emacs.

     In such cases, the command ‘tramp-rename-files’ can be used to
     alter remote buffers’ method, host, and/or directory names.  This
     permits saving their contents in the same location via another
     network path, or somewhere else entirely (including locally).
     *note Renaming remote files::.

   • How to prevent TRAMP from clearing the ‘recentf-list’?

     When TRAMP cleans a connection, it removes the respective remote
     file name(s) from ‘recentf-list’.  This is needed, because an
     unresponsive remote host could trigger ‘recentf’ to connect that
     host again and again.

     If you find the cleanup disturbing, because the file names in
     ‘recentf-list’ are precious to you, you could add the following two
     forms in your ‘~/.emacs’ after loading the ‘tramp’ and ‘recentf’
     packages:

          (remove-hook
           'tramp-cleanup-connection-hook
           #'tramp-recentf-cleanup)
          (remove-hook
           'tramp-cleanup-all-connections-hook
           #'tramp-recentf-cleanup-all)

   • I get a warning ‘Tramp has been compiled with Emacs a.b, this is
     Emacs c.d’
   • I get an error ‘tramp-file-name-handler: Invalid function:
     tramp-compat-with-mutex’

     TRAMP comes with compatibility code for different Emacs versions.
     When you see such a message (the text might differ), you don’t use
     the Emacs built-in version of TRAMP.  In case you have installed
     TRAMP from GNU ELPA, see the package README file for instructions
     how to recompile it.

   • I get an error ‘Remote file error: Forbidden reentrant call of
     Tramp’

     Timers, process filters and sentinels, and other event based
     functions can run at any time, when a remote file operation is
     still running.  This can cause TRAMP to block.  When such a
     situation is detected, this error is triggered.  It should be fixed
     in the respective function (sending an error report will help), but
     for the time being you can suppress this error by the following
     code in your ‘~/.emacs’:

          (setq debug-ignored-errors
                (cons 'remote-file-error debug-ignored-errors))

   • How to disable other packages from calling TRAMP?

     There are packages that call TRAMP without the user ever entering a
     remote file name.  Even without applying a remote file syntax, some
     packages enable TRAMP on their own.  How can users disable such
     features.

        − ‘ido.el’

          Disable TRAMP file name completion:

               (customize-set-variable 'ido-enable-tramp-completion nil)

        − ‘rlogin.el’

          Disable remote directory tracking mode:

               (rlogin-directory-tracking-mode -1)

   • How to disable TRAMP?

        − To keep Ange FTP as default the remote files access package,
          set this in ‘.emacs’:

               (customize-set-variable 'tramp-default-method "ftp")

          If you want to enable Ange FTP’s syntax, add the following
          form:

               (tramp-change-syntax 'simplified)

        − To disable both TRAMP (and Ange FTP), set ‘tramp-mode’ to
          ‘nil’ in ‘.emacs’.  *Note*, that we don’t use
          ‘customize-set-variable’, in order to avoid loading TRAMP.

               (setq tramp-mode nil)

        − To deactivate TRAMP for some look-alike remote file names, set
          ‘tramp-ignored-file-name-regexp’ to a proper regexp in
          ‘.emacs’.  *Note*, that we don’t use ‘customize-set-variable’,
          in order to avoid loading TRAMP.

               (setq tramp-ignored-file-name-regexp "\\`/ssh:example\\.com:")

          This is needed, if you mount for example a virtual file system
          on your local host’s root directory as ‘/ssh:example.com:’.

        − To unload TRAMP, type ‘M-x tramp-unload-tramp <RET>’.
          Unloading TRAMP resets Ange FTP plugins also.

8 How file names, directories and localnames are mangled and managed
********************************************************************

* Menu:

* Localname deconstruction::    Splitting a localname into its component parts.
* External packages::           Integrating with external Lisp packages.


File: tramp.info,  Node: Localname deconstruction,  Next: External packages,  Up: Files directories and localnames

8.1 Splitting a localname into its component parts
==================================================

TRAMP package redefines lisp functions ‘file-name-directory’ and
‘file-name-nondirectory’ to accommodate the unique file naming syntax
that TRAMP requires.

   The replacements dissect the file name, use the original handler for
the localname, take that result, and then re-build the TRAMP file name.
By relying on the original handlers for localnames, TRAMP benefits from
platform specific hacks to the original handlers.


File: tramp.info,  Node: External packages,  Prev: Localname deconstruction,  Up: Files directories and localnames

8.2 Integrating with external Lisp packages
===========================================

8.2.1 File name completion
--------------------------

Sometimes, it is not convenient to open a new connection to a remote
host, including entering the password and alike.  For example, this is
nasty for packages providing file name completion.  Such a package could
signal to TRAMP, that they don’t want it to establish a new connection.
Use the variable ‘non-essential’ temporarily and bind it to non-‘nil’
value.

     (let ((non-essential t))
       ...)

8.2.2 File attributes cache
---------------------------

Keeping a local cache of remote file attributes in sync with the remote
host is a time-consuming operation.  Flushing and re-querying these
attributes can tax TRAMP to a grinding halt on busy remote servers.

   To get around these types of slow-downs in TRAMP’s responsiveness,
set the ‘process-file-side-effects’ to ‘nil’ to stop TRAMP from flushing
the cache.  This is helpful in situations where callers to
‘process-file’ know there are no file attribute changes.  The let-bind
form to accomplish this:

     (let (process-file-side-effects)
       ...)

   For asynchronous processes, TRAMP uses a process sentinel to flush
file attributes cache.  When callers to ‘start-file-process’ know
beforehand no file attribute changes are expected, then the process
sentinel should be set to the default state.  In cases where the caller
defines its own process sentinel, TRAMP’s process sentinel is
overwritten.  The caller can still flush the file attributes cache in
its process sentinel with this code:

     (unless (memq (process-status proc) '(run open))
       (dired-uncache remote-directory))

   Since TRAMP traverses subdirectories starting with the root
directory, it is most likely sufficient to make the ‘default-directory’
of the process buffer as the root directory.

8.2.3 Timers
------------

Timers run asynchronously at any time when Emacs is waiting for sending
a string to a process, or waiting for process output.  They can run any
remote file operation, which would conflict with the already running
remote file operation, if the same connection is affected.  TRAMP
detects this situation, and raises the ‘remote-file-error’ error.  A
timer function should avoid this situation.  As a minimum, it should
protect itself against this error, by wrapping the timer function body
as follows:

     (ignore-error 'remote-file-error
       ...)

9 How to Customize Traces
*************************

TRAMP messages are raised with verbosity levels ranging from 0 to 10.
TRAMP does not display all messages; only those with a verbosity level
less than or equal to ‘tramp-verbose’.

   The verbosity levels are

    0 silent (no TRAMP messages at all)
 1 errors
 2 warnings
 3 connection to remote hosts (default verbosity)
 4 activities
 5 internal
 6 sent and received strings
 7 file caching
 8 connection properties
 9 test commands
10 traces (huge)
11 call traces (maintainer only)

   With ‘tramp-verbose’ greater than or equal to 4, messages are also
written to a TRAMP debug buffer.  Such debug buffers are essential to
bug and problem analyses.  For TRAMP bug reports, set the
‘tramp-verbose’ level to 6 (*note Bug Reports::).

   The debug buffer is in *note (emacs)Outline Mode::.  In this buffer,
messages can be filtered by their level.  To see messages up to
verbosity level 5, enter ‘C-u 6 C-c C-q’.  Other navigation keys are
described in *note (emacs)Outline Visibility::.

   TRAMP handles errors internally.  Hence, to get a Lisp backtrace, the
following settings are required:

     (setq debug-on-error t
           debug-on-signal t)

   If ‘tramp-verbose’ is greater than or equal to 10, Lisp backtraces
are also added to the TRAMP debug buffer in case of errors.

   In very rare cases it could happen, that TRAMP blocks Emacs.  Killing
Emacs does not allow inspecting the debug buffer.  In that case, you can
instruct TRAMP to mirror the debug buffer to a file:

     (customize-set-variable 'tramp-debug-to-file t)

   The debug buffer is written as a file in your
‘temporary-file-directory’, which is usually ‘/tmp/’.  Use this option
with care, because it could decrease the performance of TRAMP actions.

   If ‘tramp-verbose’ is greater than or equal to 11, TRAMP function
call traces are written to the buffer ‘*trace-output*’.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title
     Page” means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work’s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)
     To “Preserve the Title” of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section “Entitled XYZ” according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled “History” in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          “History” section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”,
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          “Endorsements” or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of
     a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     “History” in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You
     must delete all sections Entitled “Endorsements.”

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
     “Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License “or any later version” applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A “Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     “CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     “Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the “with...Texts.” line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
